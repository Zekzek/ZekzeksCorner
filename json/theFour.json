			"The gnarled roots of a scraggly pine tree clung to the very peak of the tallest mountain in the Gigan Mountain Range, a growing, black cloud writhing into position behind it. The cloud folded over itself, boiling angrily in the sky, and growing ever darker. When at last it seemed it could darken no more, a violent light shot from its center, illuminating the sky as it crashed down on the lone pine. The dry needles burst into ash and smoke while the spindly branches exploded into charred splinters. A moment later, the world returned to darkness, except for a few glowing embers in the charred stump which remained",
			"From a nearby peak, a stout dwarf in a crimson red robe admired the scene. This was the purpose of his pilgrimage. He had journeyed far to tap the power of the heavens so that it might be used against his enemies. With a deep breath, Thundrax closed his eyes and focused his mind on his next task. His hands flew outward as he uttered the spell carried through the ages by what was left of his people, the dwarfish mages. The cloud contorted violently as dozens of bolts cut through the sky, converging on his form. He continued the spell even as the power tore through his body in search of earth, the element that would counter its destructive nature and give it peace. The wiry hair of his beard sizzled with the energy, curling in on itself as it burned away. After what seemed an eternity, the lightning left the young dwarf's body, leaving him charred, and very near death. Thundrax knew the spell had to be finished and tried his best to ignore the unbearable pain and darkening vision. He forced his lips to form the words, even as his body crumpled to the hard rock beneath him. The sounds that followed were mere whispers, lost in the thin mountain air.",
            "With the spell at last complete, he let go of his tenuous grip on consciousness, and waited for the world to slip away. It didn't. He remained awake for every moment of the excruciating pain, incapable of even putting together a coherent thought. When he finally came to his sense, and opened his eyes, wispy white clouds were the first thing they saw. He gingerly wet his charred lips before speaking once again, barely louder than before, \"Roghk Klagdin\". It was the first spell he had ever learned, a minor healing spell. A faint glow quickly resonated and disappeared from his body, and he felt a step further from death. He muttered the spell a dozen more times until he was at last able to get back onto his feet.",
            "The task accomplished at last, Thundrax prepared for his journey home. He double-checked that his worn, leather pack was secure and grabbed hold of the thin, red, dragon's scale that hung from his neck. A soft blow into its tip created a low hum, deep and pure. Suddenly, he was thrown off the sheer mountain cliff by a gust of wind, and sent hurtling into the abyss below. A quick glance back to the mountain's peak revealed an enormous red blur, swooping down after him. As he tumbled through the air, he saw the red mass glide down beside him. A quick, well-placed hand was all that Thundrax needed to put himself on the back of the gigantic beast. As he did, the dragon gently arched out of the dive, crushing Thundrax to her scaly hide.",
            "\"You have got to stop doing that!\"",
            "\"Why?\", answered a female, reptilian voice, \"Scared you, did I?\" ",
            "\"N...No!\", Thundrax stumbled, \"I am Thundrax of the legendary Dwarfish mages. It would take a great deal more than you, Natalia, to scare me.\" ",
            "\"Really? Maybe I shouldn't catch you so soon next time.\" ",
            "\"Next time? You aren't going to do that again, are you?\" ",
            "\"Are you sure you're not scared?\" ",
            "\"Never! Especially not from some beast as brainless as you\" ",
            "At that, Natalia tore into a death roll, barrelling down towards the earth. Thundrax let loose a blood-curdling cry as he fought to remain on her back, the wind tugging at his stout form. When she finally broke out of the roll, she had to pull her feet close to her body so that they didn't scrape the ground. ",
            "\"Oh. I guess I'll just stop trying then\", she spoke innocently. ",
            "\"I...I...I can't believe you just did that! Stop your foolish horseplay and take me to the Falls of Evermore\" ",
            "\"Well, you're no fun\", Natalia quipped as she rose higher into the sky and set a course for the legendary falls."

            "He awoke, slowly, numb at first, and soon felt an incredible pain in his head. As he broke through the veil of unconsciousness, the pain intensified. He carefully opened his eyes. There were huge trees spread out before him, set in rows as if planted there purposely. Beyond them, the sky was streaked with the vibrant colors of sunset. He blinked slowly, then noticed a glint he hadn't before. It took some concentration to focus on the axe, which stuck from the side of a tree like a low-hanging branch. His first thought was to run; He didn’t know if the weapon’s owner would return. As he tried to stand, he became dizzy and had to sit for a moment. It was at that moment that he saw the extent of the carnage; hundreds of orcs and dwarves, dozens of trolls and ogres, even a few dragons… all dead. He realized then that he had no idea which race he belonged to. At first glance, he appeared to be an ogre. But he was too short and bulky, had wide, green scales like a dragon, and had a thick tail. Clearly he couldn’t be any of the creatures he saw before him, but what then? ",
            "When he again tried to stand, he felt very weak, and had to lean against a tree. After a few moments, he attempted to support himself again. As he pulled away, the thick sap of the tree tugged slightly back at his head. Slightly annoyed, he went to brush the substance away, and was surprised to find it warm. When he again looked at his hand, he found it covered in blood. ",
            "Suddenly, pure instinct took over and he watched his hands curiously as they performed their practiced dance. First, he grabbed some fresh leaves and staggered to a near-by stream. Once there, he grabbed two rocks from the stream and snatched up some berries. He used the rocks to grind the berries into a paste. He then washed his head, applied the berry paste, rinsed the leaves off and used them to cover the wound. Once it was all over, he curled up under a small bush beside the babbling brook and allowed himself to once again fade into unconsciousness. "

            "Half a day’s ride later, the two came within sight of the falls. It was easy to see why they were considered legendary. The falls draped over a cliff easily ten times the size of the one Natalia had knocked Thundrax from. At the top, the falls spanned the width of three full size dragons, and at the bottom, nearly that of six. The edges of the falls bounced from ledge to rocky ledge, splitting and creating small falls, which weaved to and from their mother. The main fall roared down the center, falling almost entirely uninterrupted. The mist from this fall blanketed the area, catching and reflecting the light of the sun into a vibrant rainbow. The crashing water had turned the base of the falls into one large lake. A river flowed from the lake, snaking its way through a dense jungle, weaving through clumps of trees with ease.. ",
            "\"You want the base or the summit?\" Natalia yelled over the rushing wind. ",
            "\"I need to go to the base,\" Thundrax answered. ",
            "\"We’ll have to land soon, then\" ",
            "\"What?! We’re still half a day’s walk from the falls\" ",
            "\"Calm down. I can get you a little bit closer but the mist is too thick for me to see through up ahead. I need to land now unless you want me to try landing blind closer up.\" ",
            "\"Okay, okay. The ride’s bumpy enough when you can see. Take us down.\" ",
            "\"You’re lucky I can barely see, or I’d have you screaming for mercy again,\" Natalia said as she found a nice spot by the river to land. ",
            "\"Ha-ha. I told you it would take more than you to scare me\" Thundrax called out triumphantly. ",
            "Natalia sloped down to land in one of the few open spots next to the river, \"Really?\" ",
            "\"I thought you could barely see\" Thundrax squeaked out as he gripped Natalia’s scales tightly for the final descent. ",
            "Natalia slowed herself, hovering for a moment before landing gracefully in a thin layer of mud. ",
            "\"We’re here. You can pry your fingers out from between my scales now\" ",
            "\"Hey! What’s that supposed to mean?\" Thundrax retaliated as he slid from the giant beast’s back. ",
            "He hit the mud with a splat and waited a moment for the airsickness to wear off. ",
            "\"Oh, just that you were clinging to me like a newborn ape to its mother\" Natalia said as she slinked off behind some trees. ",
            "\"Where are you going?\" Thundrax asked as he sat down on a nearby rock and stretched his soar muscles. ",
            "\"Just slipping into something a bit less… bulky\" came a voice from the trees. ",
            "A deep red glow then lit up the trees before disappearing into the chest of the beautiful woman who was walking from them. ",
            "\"Whaaa…\" was all Thundrax could get out before he saw the bare body of the woman standing before him. There was a playful smile across her full lips, and a joyous look in her emerald-green eyes. Her wavy, golden hair draped over her shoulders, hanging just above her full breasts, her nipples raised up in the cold, humid air. Her torso sucked in around her belly button before flaring out to her hips, which swayed as she walked. Another golden patch of hair lay between her smooth, firm thighs. Her calves bulged slightly near the top before narrowing to her feet, whose short, plump toes tended to wiggle between steps. ",
            "\"Can I have my clothes now\" Natalia smirked, pleased at the results her natural form had produced. ",
            "\"Um…ah…yeah\" Thundrax stumbled before reaching into his pack for the dress she had asked him to hold for her. ",
            "\"Surprised, Thundrax? I told you I’d show you my true form someday\" Natalia slowly walked closer. ",
            "He looked up with a smirk \"They don’t seem to be in here\". ",
            "\"Ah…I guess I’ll have to change into something with a bit more insulation\" she replied as she began the spell. ",
            "\"Wait\" Thundrax stumbled \"here it is\". Thundrax held out an inferno red dress. ",
            "\"Oh\" she covered her mouth in mach surprise \"You found it\". ",
            "Natalia slowly glided over and gently took the dress. She then lifted it over her head and let it slide slowly down the length of her body. ",
            "\"Okay, so the falls are that way, and we have about a quarter day of light left. Let’s get going\" she said as she stretched her hands into the air. ",
            "Thundrax shook his head, as if coming out of a daze \"Oh…yeah, I guess we should get going\". ",
            "He stood and picked a path by the river, as the trees were far too dense everywhere else. Natalia leaped a few times to catch up, trying to walk at his side. When she found the path too narrow, she contented herself to walk behind him. ",
            "Thundrax was almost glad he couldn’t see the beauty that followed him. Whenever he looked at her, his mind got swept away and he had to push upstream to get it back. Even though she was now clothed, the dress that she was wearing clung to her curves as though a part of her. The neck line plunged down, revealing a rounded corner of each breast and the base hung half way up her thigh, bouncing upward slightly as she took each step. Even now that she was behind him, he saw her every time he closed his eyes. It took all he had to concentrate on the path and avoid the thought of her. ",
            "It was starting to get dark now and, even though he wanted to press on, he knew they needed to rest. His power-struck body reminded him of that with every step he took. He looked up once again and barely found what he had been searching for, a hidden break in the foliage on a small hill, surrounded by trees. This was the perfect spot to rest.  ",
            "\"Ah, finally\" Thundrax sighed \"we rest here tonight\". ",
            "\"Fine, I’ll gather some firewood, and you set us up some shelter\" ",
            "He looked back for a second before he could catch himself. Natalia only smiled and started back down the trail for firewood. As he watched her walk away, he noticed the smile on his own face, then shook his head and set to setting up shelter. His pack held the tarp that he draped over a low hanging branch. He carefully staked the corners down, and laid a sturdy blanket down on the ground. ",
            "\"Shelter’s up\", he said as he turned around, \"How’s th…\" ",
            "Natalia was sitting on the biggest log she had gathered. Apparently, she had already finished and begun to watch him work. ",
            "\"Great, but where’s mine\" She asked with a smirk. ",
            "Thundrax’s face burned red for a moment before he was able to cancel his blush \"You get the left half\". ",
            "\"I think someone is trying to get in bed with me\" she joked. ",
            "\"I would never\" he protested, \"This is a tent, not a bed\". ",
            "She stifled a laugh \"Either way, shouldn’t we see to dinner\" ",
            "\"Oh, yes\", he said as he rummaged through his pack, \"I have a loaf of bread and some cheese here. I also have some dried Kroakerbeast, if you’d like\". ",
            "\"A sandwich for dinner? Wow, you sure do know how to treat a lady\" she replied with a smirk. ",
            "\"Hey. I’ll keep it all if you’re going to be like that about it\". ",
            "\"No, No\" she said as she walked over to him \"but let’s at least get some water back into that meat\". ",
            "\"Fine\" he admitted, handing the meat to her \"I guess we’ll have to hunt a little tomorrow\". ",
            "\"Either that or I’ll have to turn back into a mouse\" she replied as she walked towards the river. ",
            "Thundrax just smiled and started setting up sticks for the fire as Natalia dipped the meat in a crystal clear pond, which shot off of the main river. Once he had a nice sized pile built up, Thundrax tried out a little of his electrical power on a small stick he had chosen to start the fire. A sizeable spark leaped from his hand, but the stick was too damp to catch. ",
            "Just then, Natalia returned with the meat \"Need a hand with that\". ",
            "\"I’ll get it\" Thundrax grunted in response \"this wood is just a little damp\". ",
            "Once she had placed the meat on the loaf of bread, Natalia walked over to help him with the fire. She reached a hand towards the pile of sticks and released a small ball of flame into its center. The ball only took a second to dry out the wood enough to light it, and send a few glowing embers into the air. ",
            "Thundrax jumped up and back a step \"What are you trying to do? Burn my beard off?\" ",
            "Natalia couldn’t help but chuckle, \"I can’t make it much worse. That storm you called down on yourself did quite a number on it.\" ",
            "\"Yeah, well just warn me next time\" he grumbled as he attempted to smooth out the sizzled patch of hair. ",
            "\"Anyways, the meat is ready if you’re ready to eat\" She changed the subject while she walked over to put the sandwiches together. ",
            "\"Yeah…let’s eat\" he said as he followed her to the food. ",
            "By the time they had both eaten their fill, the fire was starting to die down. ",
            "\"Well…I guess we’d better be getting some sleep now; tomorrow’s going to be a long day\" Thundrax explained tentatively. ",
            "\"You’re right\" she agreed as she threw another log on the fire \"Would you mind taking first watch\"? ",
            "\"Sure\" he said as he packed up the remnants of dinner \"See you at midnight\". ",
            "Thundrax sat down on the ground, by the fire, and watched as Natalia curled up under his makeshift shelter. He couldn’t help watching her until she fell asleep, which took no time at all. Then, he began practicing his spells and experimenting with his newfound powers. "

            "As he walked though the fog, it split open, offering a glimpse of what lay beyond it. Three beautiful women stood in a shallow lake, a small waterfall behind them. The closest wore intricately-engraved, steel armor across her full chest and narrow torso, wrapping between her legs. It left her strong, smooth thighs completely exposed. Additional strips of the ornate metal wrapped her forearms, calves, and feet. A sai hung from either side of her waist. Her golden hair was cut short, stopping midway down her neck. Her deep green eyes stared confidently into the distance. ",
            "Another stood behind her, draped in a long, low cut robe with detailed embroidery circling her wrists, waist, and shoulders. Slits were cut into it revealing glimpses of her long, shapely legs and concave torso when she moved. She held onto a staff in her left hand covered in a myriad of detailed carvings, including some of burning fire, lightning, and ocean waves. Her auburn hair flowed over her shoulders, nearly reaching her waist. Her eyes shone a brilliant blue. ",
            "The third stood to their left, the hilt of a great sword jutting up over her left shoulder. She was covered in solid-black, bulky armor. Small thorns lined it everywhere, with long, sharp shards of the dark metal jutting out by her shoulders, elbows, knees, and toes. She held a helmet under her arm, covered in the same small thorns with two giant horns. It had huge red eyes painted over its narrow eye slits. Her short, fiery hair folded gently into itself. Her eyes were so dark a hue of brown that her pupils melted into it. ",
            "For a moment, he thought he saw another figure behind the waterfall, but it slipped away before he could be sure he even saw anything. ",
            "As the three walked across the lake, the fog shifted a bit and he could see the huge cliff they were moving towards. The first woman looked back at the other two and nodded. The second held her staff in the air and began chanting unfamiliar words. Her robe whipped in the wind, her hair wrapped around her body and the water spun into a vortex at her feet, spiraling up into a column a few feet in front of her. She tilted her staff forward and the water flew towards the cliff, freezing into jagged shards of ice on the way. As they neared the edge of the cliff, the shards crashed into an invisible barrier, folding in on itself and sliding to the ground below. ",
            "The third woman put her helmet on, and then grabbed the great sword from across her back. She slapped the blade with one hand and a spark ran down it, crackling up and down the blade as the woman sprinted towards the barrier, sword-first. Her sword rebounded off of the barrier, its spark dissolving into it and the woman crashed into the barrier soon after. She was knocked back in a daze, but still managing to catch herself with her left foot. ",
            "Although he was intrigued by the scene being played out through the fog, he couldn’t help noticing that his forehead was starting to sweat profusely, a warm, gooey liquid dripping slowly down. "

            "He awoke, with a start, to a wolf’s head bigger than his own. Its saliva slowly dripped down his face, falling onto the leaves he had used as a pillow. It began sniffing at his make-shift bandage, but showed no sign of aggression. He lifted a trembling hand slowly to pat its head, but an instant before he touched the wolf, a strong, kind voice called from his left, \"Walf\". The wolf instantly turned and ran towards the voice. He sat up to see the source of the voice and was met with an equally powerful sight. A profound woman stood there, wearing clothes made of wumpus hide. The fur had been formed into a small, skin-tight top and an equally mobile pair of shorts. Another, longer strip of the coarse pelt hung behind her as a cloak. Her long, straight, auburn hair flowed around her pointed ears and into a large hood. Her body was sleek, yet looked strong. In her hands sat a long bow, smooth from use. Her hazel eyes darted at him and scrutinized his very soul. ",
            "\"Who are you?\" she asked, all kindness gone from her voice. ",
            "\"I…\" he started, \"I’m not exactly sure.\" ",
            "\"What?\", the woman stared at him skeptically. ",
            "\"Okay… The first thing I remember is waking up over there with a really bad headache. My head was bleeding so I came over here and dressed the wound. Then I got really tired and fell asleep here.\" ",
            "Once he had finished his explanation, Walf slowly walked over and gently licked his hand. The woman sighed. ",
            "\"Looks like you’ve been granted a reprieve\". She had relaxed her tone considerably, but it still lacked the kindness granted to Walf. \"I’ve been living with this wolf for twenty years now and he has yet to lead me astray.\" ",
            "With that, she turned and began walking away. After a few steps, she stopped abruptly and turned back to face the scaly creature. Walf still stood at the creature’s side and her eyes drifted to Walf’s. ",
            "\"My name is Ekosa\" she said unexpectedly. Her eyes drifted up to meet the scaled creature’s and her voice was, at last, kind towards him. ",

            "They walked slowly through the battlefield as bodies of every sort decayed around them. The smell burned its way into their nostrils and held fast. The death continued as far as the eye could see, with many of the bodies charred or ripped in half. ",
            "\"Well\" Ekosa said, \"Have you decided on some equipment yet? I can’t wait forever you know. We need to get going.\" ",
            "\"Wha…\" Feakew responded in a haze. ",
            "The death seemed to go on forever; its finality mocking his own fragile life. ",
            "\"Yeah\", he responded as he shook off the shock and quickly grabbed a rusty battle-ax and a shield taller than he was. ",
            "\"Okay, I see letting you decide was a mistake\", Ekosa scolded. \"Try out this ax. From these engravings, it looks like it belonged to someone important. It’s possible it has some magical properties, but at the very least it’s in good condition.\" ",
            "Feakew could feel his face flush as he set his ill-chosen equipment on the ground and took the finely crafted ax as his own. He then walked forward a bit and found a curved round shield with a point at its base that was just a little shorter than he was. The edge of the shield was littered with small spikes and dangling rings of jagged metal, probably designed to make a ramming strike with the shield particularly useful. He picked the wide shield up and examined the engraved snapping turtle which covered its surface. The scaly, shelled creature was looking up from its native marsh with an odd look of familiarity. It was the first head he had seen that looked even remotely similar to his. ",
            "\"Better?\" he joked, tentatively. ",
            "\"It fits your size a little better, but I’d prefer something a little less bulky. It’s hard to slip through a battle with all that junk.\" ",

            "\"Okay, fine. Let’s just get moving again\" ",
            "Feakew instinctively spun the shield around and set it across his back. Suddenly, the entire backside of his body erupted in an intense, itchy, tingling sensation and he tensed as though he had just been stabbed in the spine. His scales slid up around the shield, holding it in place as a thick, metal shell across his back. In mere moments the intense sensation had passed. ",
            "\"Feakew?\", Ekosa nervously questioned as she stared at the transformation. ",
            "Feakew stretched and tested his movement with his new shell, and was surprised by his mobility. ",
            "\"I think I’m okay\", he reported. ",
            "\"It looks like you found a magical shield. We better be off to see a few friends of mine.\" ",
            "\"But I thought you were in some big hurry to go somewhere important.\" ",
            "\"I was doing my rounds, but this is more important.\" ",

            "Ekosa set a very fast pace, which Feakew tried his very best to keep, but half a day later he wasn't even sure he was with her anymore. He began to notice that the trees were losing their perfect spacing. At first, they had only wavered a bit from their rows, but now they were jumping every which way. He was starting to have a lot of trouble following the trail. As they traveled even further, the trees completely abandoned their spacing and were beginning to become surrounded by dense foliage. It took him forever to get anywhere even with his guide coming back for him, and pointing out the easiest routes. After a long stretch that he would have assumed impassible, they came to a large opening. There were only a few trees scattered in this pocket, but the trees were bigger than any he had ever seen before. Their trunks were twice as wide as he was, and their branches spread out nearly a dragon’s breadth in every direction. ",

            "\"Just one more test and I’ll wake Natalia and get some sleep,\" Thundrax mumbled to himself as he clumsily scrambled up to the first branch of a small tree. From his perch, he could see his target, an elder skeer tree, perfectly. The skeers near his homeland had been used for target practice for generations because there bark was incredibly tuff, and, as far as he knew, fireproof. Once he had gotten into position, he was delighted to find that an opening in the branches left its trunk susceptible to his attack. Thundrax closed his eyes to concentrate and pressed his palms together. He though back to his days as a student and raised his elbows high, so that he could better control the powers he was about to summon. Once he felt the power start to surge, he slowly opened his eyes and pulled his hands apart. He could see the lightning jumping between his hands. With one swift motion, he threw his palms out towards the tree’s trunk. The resulting flash lit the area up as if it were still midday. It hit with a massive ‘crack’ that reverberated through Thundrax’s bones. The lightning was gone, but another small light still shone brightly at the tree’s base. The tree had caught fire. Thundrax had been able to do what his elders had not, burn the bark of an ancient skeer and set its trunk on fire. Thundrax watched proudly as, in the relatively dim light of the fire, the tree started to sway. It kept going. He had just brought down an ancient skeer…right in the middle of their camp. ",
            "\"Natalia,\" Thundrax uttered as he jumped from the limb, desperate to find her before the tree did. By the time he hit the ground, the tree was nearly upon him. He had to half-dive, half-topple to the side to avoid being crushed himself. What had he done? In his own selfish lust for power, he had forgotten what he really cared about. He had killed her. ",
            "He walked in a half daze towards the disaster and found the tarp he had used to make the tent half under the fallen skeer. ",
            "\"I knew we were getting off to a rocky start, but you didn’t have to try to kill me,\" a voice joked from behind him. ",
            "Thundrax turned, reality slowly pushing the daze aside, and found Natalia leaning against a tree, an obvious smile across her face. ",
            "\"But…How…You were…\" Thundrax stumbled. ",
            "\"You woke me up with that awful racket of yours\", Natalia explained. \"It’s my shift isn’t it\"? ",
            "\"Yeah\" Thundrax stumbled as he pulled at the tarp sticking out from under the tree, \"but I was hoping to see one of our scouts before we switched\". ",
            "\"Scouts?\" ",
            "\"Yeah,\" Thundrax replied, \"my clan lives in a system of caves behind the falls. We send out scouts at night to patrol the area and watch for those returning from pilgrimage. They should have found us by now.\" ",
            "\"Okay, so let’s go check it out,\" Natalia urged. ",
            "\"Easy for you to say,\" Thundrax retaliated, \"you just woke up.\" ",
            "\"Here,\" Natalia said as she pulled some leaves off a nearby fern, \"chew on these; they’ll keep you awake for a few hours, but when they wear off, you had better be ready to sleep.\" ",

            "As Feakew walked through the slender, knot-shaped opening in the wall of trees, he found an elaborate system of roots, vines, and branches, which created stairs. He followed the path of that staircase and it carried him at least a dragon’s breadth into the air. When it finally released him, he stood looking out over a huge room, in which a solid floor of branch beams and vine supports held a group of elder women sitting crossed-legged in a circle. ",

He walked with increasing speed over to the circle of elders that Ekosa had indicated. When he got there, Ekosa gently eased him into the center of the circle. There, the elders stood, and began poking and prodding him from all angles while speaking in the same language the guard had used, saying things like \"ya, sna, itla napula\". He looked to Ekosa for some sort of an explanation, but received only a suspenseful look in return. Just then, one of the women bumped his shield and a new eruption of comments and mumblings took hold of the women. ",

            "Thundrax stood quietly behind the last tree before the falls. The area was covered in a fog so thick he could barely see the entrance to the cave a mere dragon’s breadth away. The fall’s roar deafened him as he silently motioned Natalia to follow. He was beginning to seriously worry. A guard would have always been posted at the entrance to the cave. He turned to find Natalia beside him and motioned her to follow him close. With a quick glance around, he made a mad dash for the opening to his cave. Once there, he flattened himself to the cave wall, just in case someone was looking. A careful glance into the entrance revealed more of the emptiness. With a feeling of dread in his stomach, he looked down to where the trip wire should have been, but saw nothing. On closer inspection, he found the small hook, which protruded from the wall to hold the wire. His worst fears were realized. Someone had forced there way in. But who even knew of this place? ",

By the time he was able to get a good look at it, the cave troll had her in a bear hug. He lifted his hand to fire a bolt at the beast, but suddenly felt very faint. His eyelids snapped closed and he was vaguely aware of his body smacking into something hard. "

He was lying at the bottom of a pit, which his clan used to stop those who drank to much ale from hurting themselves. The pit was at least three times as deep as he was tall and the ladder that carried him in was safely secured on the wall above. As his eyes drifted down, relief and anxiety washed over him simultaneously. Natalia was lying, curled into a ball, in a corner of the pit. Her dress was covered in filth and torn part of the way down one side, but she appeared to be uninjured  Thundrax quickly scuttled over to her form and gently stroked her shoulder. ",

As he rounded the corner, he stopped and his mouth hung open. ",
            "\"Charnig?\", he whispered as he stared at the mound in the middle a T-shaped intersection. He hurried over to the spot to find Charnig’s bloody face staring up at him. ",

Get it out.\" He flopped a hand on the solid wall across from the corridor and a grunted spell later, another path emerged. \"Go\", he muttered before allowing his body to slump into a lifeless heap on the ground. ",
            "\"Farewell, old friend\", Thundrax whispered. He slipped down the new corridor and replaced the wall behind him before continuing down the hall. The hall was pitch dark aside from a row of torches which lit at Thundrax’s approach, and their light was swiftly quenched once he'd taken a few strides past them. The path soon sloped downward into a small, spherical room. ",
            "Thundrax froze just before he entered the room and the torches which encircled the room all lit. He concentrated hard on the center of the room, on an artifact his race had kept safe for generations, a staff of enormous power. He slowly bent down and placed a hand on the panel in front of him. \"Kraustogh Filaman Benedite\", he growled out in the language of his ancestors. At once, a sphere of fire filled the room inches from his face and spiraled rapidly in to the glowing red stone which sat firmly in the top of the ancient staff. A mouse peeked over his shoulder as he once again placed his hand on the panel. \"Terra Foughda\", he growled out. Tiny spears of stone formed from the wall of the room and flew at the staff, skewering anything that may have been in the way and coating the staff in a protective layer of stone. Thundrax heard a loud squeak as the terrified mouse scurried back into his pack. He couldn’t help but chuckle to himself as he hopped into the room and grabbed the ancient artifact, had it not been encased in stone, it would have thrown him back just as it had every overeager mage that tried to possess it. ",
            "The artifact secure at last, Thundrax’s mind focused again on his tribe. If there were any other survivor’s, he couldn’t just leave them, could he? But he was lucky just to have made it as far as he had undetected, and now he held the artifact that his entire tribe had sworn to protect with their lives. No. As hard as it was to leave his family, there was nothing he could do to help them, even if they had survived this far. Nothing except… Thundrax quickly walked back to the panel at the entrance of the room, and tried to remember a spell from his days as a sentry. \"Ignateous Clagh\". At once, the walls became tinted red. He smirked with satisfaction knowing that now, anyone still alive could focus on escape. ",
            "A quick trot back to the center of the room, and Thundrax pushed hard at the monument which had held the artifact for so long, revealing a narrow staircase underneath. He hurried down the staircase as the torches in the room went out, and the monument slid back to its place over the staircase. He rushed down the stairs, confident that the monument would muffle the footfalls which echoed through the air. The staircase seemed to stop at a solid stone wall ahead, but Thundrax ran towards it at full speed. He flew through the illusionary wall and found himself in the middle of the dense forest outside of his cave home. ",
            "As Thundrax looked around, trying to get his bearings, a small mouse scurried up onto his shoulder. He spotted a clearing off in the distance and began to run towards it. The small mouse clung to his shoulder until they reached the clearing. She then leaped from her perch, transforming in mid-air into the red dragon she was so used to. As she changed back into the massive beast, the red gem of the artifact shone brightly through its rock prison, fading a moment later. It’s light was completely unnoticed by the terrified pair. Thundrax barely had time to jump onto Natalia’s back before she was airborne. She climbed quickly above the trees with a sense of urgency that Thundrax had never before seen in her. He just hung on tightly, as eager to get away from the mausoleum that had become of his home as she seemed to be. "

The cot that Ekosa had slept in lay empty, aside from the neatly-folded blankets which had formed Walf’s bed. He stood up slowly and yawned absently as he pulled aside the hide door to the tent and walked into the clearing. The sun was just beginning to come through the trees.

We rushed into the fight early in the morning, emerging from our muddy dwellings to strike at the intruders and reclaim our homelands.

Although the blades were uncovered from use, the rest of the axe was coated in a layer of dirt and rocks. Feakew slowly picked at the dirt, revealing the smooth steel underneath. As he got to the spot where the blades met with the handle of the axe, he noticed an unusually large chunk of rock sticking through the dirt. He tried to knock the whole chunk off, but the dirt seemed to hold it solidly in place, so he started to work at the edges. As he cleaned away the dirt, it became clear that the rock was attached to the axe, set deep in the metal. He stared at it a bit further before spitting on his finger and cleaning away what remained of the dirt. He could see then that the rock was a deep brown gemstone. It was somewhat translucent and he could see a gentle light glowing at its center. As he stared into the light, he felt something trying to well up from the pool of new knowledge the axe gave to him. He knew that the gem and the light within were important, he just couldn’t remember why. "

In order to give us a fighting chance, I am locking away the four unique sisters on the tallest peak of the Acacian mountain range. There is an odd accumulation of magic here that will be drawn upon to maintain a powerful spell. The spell I have chosen will prevent the sisters from aging, but they will not be able to leave the peak for 500 years. I will also lock myself away so that we might continue our training. Once the spell has fallen, we will be expecting to meet an emissary from our order, so that we can learn of the current events. If no such emissary appears to meet us, then we will have to assume that we were too late. We will have no choice but to cleanse the world and start anew. With any luck, we can rescue the world from the chaos that it is destined to fall into.

I tossed a little piece of my bread over to it, and it ran away. I thought I’d scared it off, but, a little while later, it popped its nose out again and grabbed the bread.\" ",

I began setting it closer, eventually getting it so that it would take a little piece from my hand. When I reached the far edge of the forest, I wondered if I’d ever see the little mouse again. I took my next break on a small cliff overlooking the forest I’d just come from. I was disappointed when I didn’t see the little mouse, so I waited a little longer than usual. Eventually, I got up and started hiking further up the mountain. When I was coming up over a small hill, I found myself face to face with a massive red dragon. I was, of course, brave, and prepared a spell to protect myself from the beast, but I got distracted when it spoke to me. She thanked me for feeding the mouse, saying it was her friend, and offered me a lift to the top of the mountain. I was a bit skeptical, so she gave me one of her scales and told me that I should blow into it if I ever needed a ride. I thanked her, but continued hiking up a thin trail. About half way up, I noticed her swooping around me. I waved to her, and she swooped down and knocked me off the mountain.\" ",

Behind it, an older man sat straight up in an equally extravagant chair, staring at the papers which covered the surface of his desk.

            "As Feakew and Thundrax walked into Malfrum, everyone they saw stole quick glances and began chattering amongst themselves. The people hurried down the one busy street, sometimes slipping down narrow alleyways between houses. There were small buildings everywhere, simple log houses with slanted, hay roofs. ",
            "\"I think they noticed us\", Thundrax joked as he headed for a nearby supply store. ",
            "Inside the store, grains of every kind sat in simple wooden barrels, fresh breads were stacked on shelves along the back wall, and all kinds of meat and ale hung behind a counter to their right. There was even a variety of simple clothing set up to the left. ",
            "\"I’m sorry sir, but I’m going to have to hold that axe for you\", a man spoke from behind the counter. ",
            "Feakew focused on the short, spindly man, \"Of course.\" He placed the axe on the counter, and then turned to find Thundrax again. ",
            "\"What all do we need?\", Feakew asked as he caught up with Thundrax. ",
            "\"I need to pick up some of these spices, some rice, and maybe a few loaves of bread. Natalia’s been bugging me for a new dress, too\", Thundrax muttered as he sniffed a particularly large barrel filled with white powder. ",
            "Feakew nodded, and started looking around himself, afraid to interfere with whatever system the dwarf had for choosing his goods. Behind the rows of barrels, there was a very plain door that almost disappeared into the wall. A small sign hung from a nail just above the door. It read, \"Exotic\". Feakew turned to ask the shopkeeper about the room, but he didn’t see him standing behind the counter anymore. Curiously, Feakew pushed the door open. The thin room was darker than the rest of the store, with only one small window, set up high on the back wall, just above a sign which read \"Professional removals: 25 gold per head\". Along the right side, tightly spaced shelves held a myriad of small clay jars, each with the name of a dangerous or intoxicating herb and a price written in black ink. On the left wall, several paintings of beautiful young women hung, a name and price written across the bottom of each in the same black ink. ",
            "\"I see you’ve found our more exotic wares\", the shopkeeper spoke as he walked towards Feakew, \"The goods in there are a bit more expensive, but well worth it if you’re looking for a good time.\" ",
            "Feakew stared at the man a moment before his eyes bulged with understanding. ",
            "\"Oh…. N-no thanks\", Feakew spurted out as he hurried back to Thundrax’s side. ",
            "\"Thundrax\", he whispered, \"Are we ready to go yet?\" ",
            "\"Um\", Thundrax looked up from the loaf of bread he was inspecting, \"Ya, I was hoping to get some bread, but none of this looks very good. I think we just need a little ale now and we’ll be set.\" ",
            "The entire time that Thundrax wandered to the counter, grabbed a bottle labeled \"Dwarven Ale\", and handed a few copper pieces to the spindly man behind the counter, Feakew never left his side. Once everything had been paid for, Feakew hurried ahead of Thundrax, towards the door. ",
            "\"Sir\", the shopkeeper called out, \"Don’t forget your axe.\" ",

            "\"Are you okay?\", Thundrax asked, following Feakew into the street. ",
            "He clenched the axe tight and took a deep breath before he answered, \"I’m fine. I just want to get out of this place.\" ",

They had just made it into a small clearing before the last house in Malfrum, when a large man stepped out in front of them wearing clothes made of thick leather. A long dagger hung from both sides of his belt. ",
            "\"I’m not gonna be able to let you two leave with your supplies\", the man said, a smirk planted firmly across his face. ",
            "Feakew and Thundrax both came to a stop in the middle of the clearing, Thundrax clapping his hands together in preparation for the spell he might be forced to cast. ",

            "The man then snapped his thick, greasy fingers and three men, armed with knives, stepped out from behind them, the shopkeeper in the middle. ",
            "The shopkeeper then spoke in a clear, commanding voice, \"Gratiga\". The newly applied leather strap that had gone unnoticed around the top of Feakew’s axe began to glow and the axe at once became too heavy for him to carry, slipping from his hands and slamming solidly into the earth at his feet. ",
            "\"Now, if you’ll just drop the pack and walk that way\", the large man pointed to the woods to Feakew’s left, \"no one has to die today.\" ",
            "Thundrax pulled his hands apart a bit, allowing the current that ran through them to be seen, \"Despite what you may think, we are not defenseless. I suggest you leave us be unless you’d like to feel this current running through your body.\" ",
            "The large man set his hands on the hilts of his daggers, threw his head back, and let loose a deep, thick laugh, \"One against four, this should be fun.\" ",
            "The man on the shopkeepers left flicked a small dagger from his coat, and hurled it deep into Thundrax’s shoulder. ",
            "The pain brought Thundrax down to one knee, his hands slapping together again, \"You’re making me do this\" he growled as he threw both palms forward towards the large man. A bolt of lightning as wide as his outstretched fingers ripped through the air, flowing directly into the man’s chest. He flew backwards, slamming into the house he had come from, and cracking a thick wooden beam. His body slumped to the ground, charred black, and what was left of his thick, leather clothes burst into flame. ",
            "The three men stared in horror at the sight for only a moment before turning and dissapearing back into the alleyways of the city. ",
            "Thundrax grit his teeth and pulled the dagger from his shoulder, a scream of agony escaping through his clenched teeth. Two small mice popped out on to his shoulder, staring at the wound with concern. Within a moment, Feakew was there. He held his hand above Thundrax’s wound and a soft blue light began to glow. The faces of Thundrax and the mice quickly changed from one of concern to one of confusion. Thundrax reached back to where the dagger had entered his body and found only a minor sore. ",
            "\"Thank you, Feakew\", he spoke in disbelief, \"How did you do that?\" ",
            "\"It’s just a little magic\", Feakew smiled, \"Now that lightning of yours. That was impressive.\" ",
            "Thundrax shook his head and mumbled to himself, \"You have more power than you know, Feakew\". ",
            "The two small mice hopped down from Thundrax’s shoulder and chewed at the leather strap on Feakew’s axe until it snapped, rolling away from the metal. ",

A spindly tree clung to life at the base of the steep slope only a few dragons’ breadths ahead. Next to it, a thin path ran up the mountain, zigzagging back and forth until it neared the peak, where a long bridge made of vines and wood hung precariously between the first peak and a massive crag behind it.

There was a small cliff at the edge of the forest. It was only about twice as high as Feakew, but they would need to find a way down, none the less. At the base of the cliff, the sand of the Sa’erit Desert stretched across the land. The sand reached all the way to the horizon, the great Acacian Mountains jutting up into the sky just beyond. "

Ekosa crested the hill just in time to see a feminine figure dressed in black armor jump down onto a rock in the center of the clearing. She had large, red eye spots on her horned helmet and was covered in jagged thorns. The figure mumbled something to an old man kneeling on the rock in front of her before pulling a huge sword from her back. The woman uttered a spell under her breath and slapped her blade with one hand, causing it to burn with a black fire. With one swift stroke, the woman lopped off the man’s head. The fire which burned along her blade glowed deep blue for a moment before fading away. The old man’s body did not slump to death. Instead, it rose to stand at the woman’s side. ",

On it stood three more figures; a brunette woman in an ornate robe who held a finely carved staff, a blond woman wearing etched steel armor and a sai on each hip, and a man with a neatly trimmed gray beard wearing a plain, black robe.

            "Once Kabul was close enough, he arced into the air, aiming straight for Ekosa’s chest. Walf countered with his own leap, catching Kabul’s outstretched right arm in his jaw and dragging him to the ground below. Kabul barely noticed that Walf was there, rolling out from under him and twisting his captured arm off at the shoulder. He lifted himself up again with his remaining arm and again leapt at Ekosa. Thundrax clapped his hands together and waited for a clear shot. Ekosa’s arrow flew from her bow, tearing through Kabul’s rib cage. The force of the impact cut his jump short, but didn’t seem to hurt him at all. He hit the ground ready to close the last pace to his target, but Thundrax’s lightning caught him before he got the chance. The bolt sent him flying through the air, his flesh burning along the way. Kabul’s flight violently ended as he crashed into a large tree, the charred flesh that covered his left leg knocking itself free with the impact. As it fell to the ground, a cracked thigh bone was made visible. Kabul attempted to run towards Ekosa again, but the damaged bone crumbled under his weight before another arrow nailed his torso to the tree. Kabul continued to flail, attempting to free himself while three more arrows secured him. ",
            "\"Natalia, burn him\", Feakew called out as he ran towards the squirming body. ",

            "\"I don’t think they need our help\", Thundrax said between heavy breaths. ",

            "Natalia slowly stood up, peaking around Thundrax’s shoulder before committing herself to leaving his side. She slowly took a few steps towards the bridge that the sisters had crossed, stretching up to get a better view, \"We’re not going to follow them, are we?\" ",
            "Walf looked towards the bridge and growled before trotting over to Feakew’s side and rubbing against his hand. ",
            "\"I don’t see any reason to\", Feakew muttered as he tugged his axe free of the tree, \"I doubt we could affect their actions much, they don’t seem to be much for conversation.\" ",
            "\"Feakew’s right\", Thundrax announced, \"The only thing they seem to understand is power and I’ve never even heard about power like there’s. If we’re going to have a chance against them, we need more power. A little practice working together as a team wouldn’t hurt either.\" ",
            "Ekosa’s glare shot to Thundrax, then drifted over to Natalia, \"We all need to join in the fighting, too.\" ",
            "Natalia glanced over and caught Ekosa’s glare, at once feeling lament wash over her, \"I’m sorry Ekosa, but I couldn’t just attack… it’s complicated.\" ",
            "\"Oh yes, Natalia. Why don’t you tell us why you looked exactly like one of those warriors when Walf and I first spotted you?\" ",
            "Natalia could feel Ekosa’s question burning into her, \"I…\" ",
            "\"Stop, Ekosa\", Feakew interrupted, \"Natalia is our companion and she is not on trial.\" ",
            "\"It’s okay, Feakew\", Natalia muttered, her head slumped, \"I should have told you about my past. Rilia, Mailay, and Sorsia are my sisters. Mailay and I are identical twins. We we’re born over 500 years ago and were renowned for our magical abilities. When the prophecy of a great battle was discovered, a great mage, Arsenatio, bound himself and us within an isolation sphere on top of this mountain. We were to be stuck within that sphere for 500 years, unable to interact with the outside world, and unable to age, so that we could fight the great threat to our world.\" ",
            "\"Wait a minute\", Ekosa questioned, \"If you were bound within that sphere, you wouldn’t have been able to leave until the barrier fell.\" ",
            "Natalia nodded, \"I learned through my training in polymorphism that certain creatures do not have a physical presence, and therefore cannot be contained by most barriers. I was able to change into one of those creatures for just long enough to make it through the barrier. That was about five years ago.\" ",
            "\"That’s impossible\", Thundrax muttered, \"The art of polymorphism is based on changing your physical form to match a creature’s and having your magical presence follow.\" ",
            "\"That is only the beginning\", Natalia explained, \"That is how I first learned to change, but with training, you can create a magical presence first, then allow a physical form to fit over it. It took me over 300 years to learn to do that. Taking the form of a creature without a physical presence is still very painful and I can’t hold it for long.\" ",
            "\"So, you’re their sister\", Ekosa said, \"How does that excuse you for hiding when the headless corpse was attacking me?\" ",
            "Natalia opened her mouth to speak, but stopped when she looked up enough to see Ekosa still staring at her. After a moment she took a deep breath, met Ekosa’s glare and cautiously spoke, \"I… I’m sorry. I’ve always been a coward when it comes to real combat. That is why my sisters would always pick on me and why I wanted so badly to escape my fate of facing the great evil which threatens to destroy our world.\" ",
            "Ekosa broke her gaze at last, sinking into her thoughts, \"If your sisters do decide to threaten our world, they will need to be stopped. Thundrax was right when he said that we don’t have that kind of power yet. We need to start training, so that we have a chance in stopping them.\" ",
            "\"They’re not evil\", Natalia muttered, \"They’re just being cautious because no emissary was sent to meet with them. I know it seems cruel, but their purpose is too important for them to be lured into a trap while they try to get their bearings.\" ",
            "\"So sending an undead minion to kill me was there way of being cautious!?\" Ekosa yelled at Natalia, \"Stop trying to defend them and deal with the fact that what they did was evil! They are a threat to this world.\" ",
            "Natalia swallowed hard, \"It was unnecessary and cruel, but they wouldn’t do anything to hurt this world. Protecting the world is the reason we sacrificed 500 years to training in an isolation sphere!\" ",
            "Feakew took a step forward, coming between the two women, \"You were stuck in that sphere because of a prophecy of a great evil that would threaten our world, right Natalia?\" ",
            "Natalia nodded. ",
            "\"Then what we must do is clear. We must train together and learn to fight side by side. Whether or not Natalia’s sisters need to be fought, a powerful force is coming and we need to be ready to help in that fight.\" ",
            "\"All right, Feakew\", Thundrax spoke from behind the group, \"Where are we going to go for this?\" ",

First, I went by the furniture store because they’re supposed to be working on the frames for battle chariots. They had barely started working on the wheels. The clothing shop refuses to put their jackets on hold so that they can work on the padding for some of the heavier armors.

As it did, he rocked his shoulders to the side and arched the bolt into a thin tree branch. The bolt ripped easily through it and continued down the cliff. Thundrax stared at the front of the bolt and concentrated on making it turn towards the earth. To his surprise, it reacted unbelievably fast, crashing straight down into the mountain before he could attempt to make it turn again. ",
            "On the opposite side of the peak, Feakew experimented with his ability to heal. He had removed the bandage from his side and was inspecting the wound he had sustained while healing Walf. He placed his hand over the wound and tried to remember what he had done when healing Walf. After some time of nothing happening, Feakew moved his hand and sighed in frustration. He glanced over to see Thundrax shoot a bolt of lightning, and then looked back at his wound. He could see where the scab was trying to form and where the flesh was split, unable to get close enough to reconnect the tissue. As he thought about the processes the wound would need to go through to heal over time, his wound began to glow faintly. As it did, he got distracted by where the light was coming from, and the light faded away. His eyes widened with curiosity as he again concentrated on the flesh sticking together and forming fresh bonds. The wound glowed again, more powerfully than before, and it slowly sealed up until it looked like just a minor scrape. ",
            "Ekosa hung in a tree across from the waterfall. She had her bow knocked and was aiming at a tree at the base of the mountain. Every time she felt as though she had the shot lined up perfectly, a gentle breeze blew one of the thin branches into her sights. Ekosa could feel her fingers get tenser with frustration each time a branch shifted. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath to calm herself, picturing the shot in her mind. Once she had regained her composure, she opened her eyes to find several branches once again in her way. She slowly exhaled in an attempt to remain calm, never blinking from her shot, and felt a gentle breeze blow at her back. The wind slowly spun through the tree, laying each of the small branches out of the way. Ekosa wasted no time in focusing on her target. She let the arrow fly and watched as it glided down the mountain and stuck firmly in the base of the tree. Just after the arrow had found its mark, the breeze stopped and the myriad of small branches fell back into her view. Ekosa stared at the branches curiously, and her brow furrowed as she worked out what just happened. She concentrated on the closest branch, took a deep breath, and slowly blew into the air. Another gust, stronger than before, blew through the tree, folding the branch out of the way. ",
            "Natalia looked around the peak, noting everyone’s progress. She silently stepped into the lake and walked over to the waterfall, the water rising up to her waist. She took a deep breath before dunking herself into the chilly water, and releasing a few words into it. Natalia’s body contorted into the shape of an eel and she glided out of her dress and through a narrow crack in the rock wall. She followed it until it opened up into another pool of water. Her head popped out of the water as she transformed her appearance back into her original form, that of a beautiful woman. ",
            "Natalia’s eyes took a moment to adjust to the darkness of the cavern. She was standing chest-deep in a pool of water. The water splashed up onto a sandy shore, churned by the waterfall on the other side. In the distance, the back wall of the cavern shone a deep green light, glowing lightly. As her eyes adjusted, she could see her hammock still hanging in the center of the cavern. She had woven it over the years out of the various roots that popped through the walls. ",
            "She carefully climbed out of the water and into her hammock. As she stretched across it, she was able to see the shelf she had carved along the back wall. On it, several intricate figures stood, formed from rock and clay. She quickly dried her hand on the mesh of roots before reaching out and running her finger along the curving neck of a dragon figurine. Her finger slipped from the dragon and her eyes lost focus as she fell into her memories. "

            "Natalia’s lip began to quiver as she stared at the woman. She ran towards the shallow lake and dove into it, turning into a fish in mid-air. The last words she heard before crashing into the noise-muffling water were, \"She ran away again!?\" ",
            "Natalia let out her frustration in quick little twitches of her tail, darting out of her clothes and through the clear water. She was so wrapped up in what had been said to her, that she didn’t notice the wall she was about to run into. She flipped her fins quickly and managed to avoid a collision, but felt all the more inferior for not even being able to swim around adequately. Despite her self-loathing, she began to realize something strange about the currents around her. They seemed to be flowing to and from the wall. A bit of searching lead her to a narrow hole that seemed to wind its way into the rock wall. Curious, she transformed herself into an eel, and slipped into the hole. After a bit of squirming, she popped out into another pool of water. That was the day she discovered the cavern that only she could reach, a private grotto. Natalia immediately felt at piece there. It was just a round room, half filled with water, but it was the only place she could call her own on the mountain peak which had become her prison. She transformed back into a woman and explored every inch of the cavern in the mysterious green light. Before she could finish her examination, she was interrupted by a call. ",

            "Natalia instinctively leaped from her hammock, transformed back into an eel, and slithered out of her grotto. She found her dress, slipped into and transformed back into her human disguise. As her head breeched the water, she gulped for air. She looked around and found Thundrax staring at her, a look of relief upon his face. ",
            "\"Where were you? ",
            "Natalia smiled, \"A few years after we arrived here, I found a place I could call my own. There is a cavern behind that waterfall that is only accessible through an opening smaller than my wrist. I have to transform into an eel in order to get there.\" Natalia’s smile faded slightly, \"I wish you could see it.\" ",

            "\"You said yourself that you have to practice any new ways you find to use your power.\" ",
            "\"Yes, but I haven’t found any new ways to transform since I became a purely magical being to escape this place, and that is much too painful to practice.\" ",
            "Thundrax’s smile widened as he turned and walked to where Natalia had set down her staff. He tossed the rough walking stick to Natalia, \"You mean to tell me that this staff transforming with you was covered in your training.\" ",
            "Natalia fumbled with the staff, but managed to catch it. She looked up at Thundrax with new excitement in her eyes and held up the staff in outstretched hands. She pictured the little red mouse she had seen before in her mind and sent a surge of magic towards the staff. The ends of the staff collapsed into themselves, and within moments a little red mouse sat in Natalia’s hands, sniffing at the air on his hind legs. "

As it left his hand, the beetle began to feel around enthusiastically with two long feelers near its head.

Unlike these other headless bodies, however, you will retain your consciousness. You will remain alive for nearly a year. You will experience every sensation your body goes through. It’s also theorized that the process of the psycholus sucking your life away is excruciatingly painful. Sadly, no one has ever been able to verify that, but I believe it to be true.\" Arsenatio snickered before continuing, \"Now, I need you to make this tower into a worthy throne. I want powerful golems at the entrance and near the stairwell on every floor. You will build two more ring-shaped structures around this tower and create pathways between them on every even-numbered floor. I will leave these bodies here to help you complete this task. Let no one but myself and my students enter. Oh, and capture one of those Xiazum that are supposed to live in this desert now. I’d like to study a specimen\" ",

            "Rashira grabbed a glass bottle full of oil from a shelf nearby and walked quietly over to her bed. She pulled her dress up a bit to move more easily as she climbed onto her bed and straddled Griak’s torso, pressing her bare thighs against him. Griak let out a low groan with the contact. ",
            "Rashira smiled at the reaction as she pulled the stopper from the bottle and sprinkled some of the oil into her hand. She slowly spread the liquid up his back, her fingers rolling over the muscles, taking note of the various knots that had formed. She sprinkled a bit more of the oil into her hand and spread it across his shoulders and arms before replacing the stopper and setting the bottle in an open spot on the bed. Once she had the oil spread out, she began moving in rhythmic circles, breaking the knots in the muscles. As he occasionally breathed in sharply, she softened her touch and took her time on the more tender areas. She continued up his back this way, into each shoulder and down each of his strong arms. Once she had most of the major knots worked out, she used long, continuous strokes across his back, shoulders, and arms to smooth out her work and keep the muscles from knotting up again as quickly. As she stretched over him with her long strokes, she allowed her breasts to slide softly across his back, eliciting another deep moan. ",
            "Once she had finished with his back, Rashira whispered softly into Griak’s ear, \"If you want to flip over, I can do your chest next.\" ",
            "Griak waited for her body to leave his own before he moved his arms in and spun his body over. He moved a little further up the bed and rested his head on a soft, down pillow, before letting his arms fall comfortably beside him. He let his eyes fall shut as he awaited the next sensation. ",
            "Rashira had her back to Griak while she replaced the bottle of oil in the shelf. When she turned to face him, she was pleased to find that she had been successful in arousing him. She grabbed the base of her red dress and slowly pulled it up over her head, setting it and the small strip of fabric she wore underneath on the stool on top of Griak’s things. ",
            "\"I’m going to need you to be wearing a bit less for this next part\", she spoke softly as she pulled gently at his pants. He arched his body slightly to reduce the resistance, and she was able to slide them off easily and add them to the growing stack of clothing. ",
            "Griak could feel his wife climb onto the bed and over him. He raised his arms and grabbed her thighs as he slowly entered her. They latched onto one another as they worked into a good rhythm, every once and a while letting out a moan of passion. After a while, his wife began biting at her lower lip and holding her breath, concentrating on a feeling welling up from within her. She let out a low cry as the feeling overwhelmed her senses. She clenched closer to Griak and he, too, moaned with satisfaction as he released himself inside his wife for the first time since that horrible accident. ",
            "Griak lay, exhausted, across the bed, his wife at his side, an arm and leg draped over him. For a moment, Griak understood that his wife hadn’t made it through the tragic accident. That he had somehow killed Draeg using her powers, and that he had slept with another woman. For a moment, he was filled with grief, guilt, and horror. Then, all at once, he convinced himself that all of that was just a horrible dream. He was lying beside his wife now and she had killed Draeg because he was plotting against them. He gave his wife a squeeze, let his muscles relax and allowed sleep to come, "

I believed in it so much at first, but everyone told me it was just a dream. They said it was impossible. I convinced myself they were right.\" ",

            "Everyone nodded their agreement, anxious to hear what had happened. ",
            "\"In my village, you are assigned a job and a mentor at three years old.

The idea is that in this way, every member of our village excels at one aspect of the workings of our village and therefore helps the village as a whole to prosper.\" ",

I studied my archery for a few years, but was unsatisfied. I dreamed of becoming a wolf sister. Wolf sisters got to leave the village every day and scout the area. They adopt a wolf and are raised with them from a very young age. They learn to read that wolf and hunt with them. A wolf sister is responsible for knowing everything that happens in there scouting area. They learn to read the tracks and trees, so that they can tell if anything new has happened in the forests surrounding our village.\" ",
            "\"So you ended up becoming a wolf sister?\" Feakew asked. ",
            "Ekosa nodded, \"A few moons before my sixth birthday, a large wolf wandered into the village. It had somehow slipped past several accomplished wolf sisters and their wolves, completely unnoticed. It was my job to kill it. That was the first time I saw Walf. I had him in my sights and was just about to let loose an arrow, when he stared directly at me. I was held by his eyes, but I could feel the disapproving scowl of my mentor at my back. I let loose the arrow, and it buried itself into the ground near Walf’s paw. He disappeared into the forest within moments. For as long as the light allowed, the wolf sisters of my village tried to find Walf. They said that his tracks disappeared for long periods and doubled back so much that it would be impossible for them to catch him.\" ",
            "\"After a lengthy lecture from my mentor, I went to my tent and tried to get some sleep. I awoke well before the sun came out to a slobbery kiss from Walf. The first thing I did was give him a big hug. I realized then that, even though he was huge, he was still just a cub. I snuck him into the elders’ tree and explained everything to them. I begged to be able to take him in and train as a wolf sister.\" ",
            "\"It felt like they deliberated forever, but they eventually agreed to allow me to switch jobs. They explained that I would not be allowed a mentor. That my new wolf would be my teacher and that I had best catch up on my training or I’d be placed back into the role of an archer. I spent that entire day learning Walf’s movements and getting to know him.\" ",
            "\"That night, I fell asleep staring into Walf’s eyes. That night, I had a dream so real I knew it was a vision passed on from Walf.\" ",
            "\"It began with me staring at a very feminine wolf. I somehow knew it was Walf’s mother. She swallowed a strange, glowing, green gem in order to keep it from a horde of ogres. Together with her mate, a very big, powerful wolf, and the rest of their pack, she was able to fight off the ogres.\" ",
            "\"I saw the sky then, and the moon in it went from new to full twice. I saw the feminine wolf again and realized that she was pregnant. It was still early, and her mate was overly attentive, trying to do everything for her.\" ",
            "Ekosa smiled at the memory, \"And then, I saw the seasons change. Two full years passed and the wolf was huge with child. Her mate cared for her meticulously, bringing her fresh meat on a regular basis and gathering soft furs to use as a bed. Finally, she went into labor. It was very hard on the mother, but she gave birth to one huge cub with brilliant green eyes, Walf. It took a long time for his mother to heal, but his father showed Walf everything he knew. Walf picked it all up amazingly quick. Once his mother was fully healed, they all traveled together and lived together with their pack. It was a very happy time for Walf.\" ",
            "Ekosa’s smile faded and tears began to swell up in her eyes, prompting a supportive head butt from Walf. She rubbed his head before continuing, \"Another year past and Walf was out alone hunting for food for the tribe. He had become skilled enough in his hunting techniques that he could easily get enough meat to feed the tribe all on his own. He was coming back to meet his pack, when he saw a dead trapper, lying on the ground. He dropped the kills he was bringing back and sprinted on. He found more bodies, wolves he had known all his life, and men with brutal-looking knives and massive bows. As he traveled further, he could hear a fight in the distance. His legs burned as he pushed them, desperate to get to the source of the disaster. He came into a clearing, and found a ring of bodies encircling his father. Arrows protruded from his father’s flesh and blood staining his fur crimson. Walf rushed to close the distance, barking to his father. His father looked to him, a glint of relief in his eyes, before collapsing to the ground. As Walf neared the body, he realized that his father had collapsed on top of another badly wounded body, the body of his mother. Walf stared in horror, desperate for a way to save them. Just then, an arm rose from behind his parents and plunged a knife through the bodies, expelling the last sliver of life that remained. The man whispered. ‘Rilia’s will be done’ before Walf was able to decapitate him with one swift swipe of his front paw.\" ",
            "Tears were streaming down Ekosa’s face, but she forced herself to continue, \"Walf wandered around in the woods for a long time after that, searching for a place to call home. In the end, he made it to our village and decided to accept me as his adopted family.\" ",
            "Walf licked Ekosa’s cheek comfortingly, and nuzzled in for a hug. ",
            "Natalia whispered softly, \"Rilia?\" ",
            "\"I know, Natalia, that’s part of why I was so angry before, but I know you couldn’t have had anything to do with it. It just hurts to imagine all of the horrors he’s gone through\", Ekosa took a moment to steady her breathing, \"We should probably get some sleep now, that story took a bit more out of me than I expected.\" ",
            "Everyone nodded, and silently set up camp. They drifted slowly off to sleep, fearing the dreams that might come to visit them. "

            "Sorsia happily climbed the stairs up into the main hall, a large stone golem following close behind. In its arms were piled a variety of tomes, both ancient, and freshly written. ",
            "\"What do you have there?\", Arsenatio questioned, pointing towards the golem. ",
            "Sorsia glanced back at the golem and smiled wide, \"I just conjured up a little muscle to help me carry my books. I figure if no one wants to talk to us about what’s been going on, we’ll have to do our own research.\" ",
            "A small smirk spread across Arsenatio’s lips, \"Very good. Now, I’d like to continue our journey. Do you have any idea where your sisters have wandered off to?\" ",
            "\"I’ll let them know we’re ready\", Sorsia spoke as she snapped her fingers and held a small, brightly glowing ball in her palm. She closed her hands around the ball, and worked at the energy, quickly revealing two smaller balls. She lifted her palms up and the orbs took off, one spiraling up the staircase, the other spinning down. ",
            "Arsenatio stroked his beard as he took a step towards the golem, scanning the titles on the books. He pulled one free from the middle of the stack labeled, ‘Conflict: 1500-2000’ and began scanning its pages. ",
            "Sorsia began walking around the sides of the round room, examining some of the tapestries and murals, \"Some of these aren’t half bad.\" ",
            "She turned to see what Arsenatio’s thought about them, but found him thoroughly immersed in the book. ",
            "After a time, Rylia wandered out of the stair case, the blue flame on her sword slowly fading away. Behind her, a heavily muscled man slipped out of the opening, the veins in his neck standing out and seared in place where his neck had been cut through. His shirt was torn almost completely off, revealing the myriad scars he had sustained in life. ",
            "Arsenatio glanced up and stifled a laugh, \"You know that their strength in life has no effect on the strength they have as a moving corpse. Why did you choose that one to bring with you?\" ",
            "Rylia looked back at her newest minion, \"If they all have the same strength, I mine as well get a pretty one to travel with.\" ",
            "Arsenatio shook his head, smiling, as Mailay appeared in the stairwell. Blood dripped from her sais, and small splatters of it covered her armor. ",
            "\"You were right, no fun to be had here. But, I did find a little souvenir.\" ",
            "Mailay put away her sais and wiped the blood from her fingers on her left hand, revealing an ornate engagement ring, mounted with a large diamond. ",
            "\"She wouldn’t give it to me when I asked, so I had to break her fingers\" She explained, showing off how the ring sparkled in the light. ",
            "Arsenatio closed his book and slipped it into a pocket of his robes before addressing the women, \"The years have not been good to this place. It will take some time for it to become a worthy throne. In the mean time, I suggest we spread out and gather support from the locals. They may not have much power individually, but in groups, with some training, they should prove useful. They can also be used quite effectively in performing some of our more menial tasks. ",
            "The three women nodded their agreement. ",
            "\"I’m going to head north; you three can decide how to split yourselves up.\" ",
            "Arsenatio turned and walked away a few steps before spinning back around and addressing the woman again, \"Don’t forget that we are now a part of prophecy. Religious fanaticism is a far greater motivator than fear, or respect of power.\" ",
            "Arsenatio tapped at his book for a few moments in thought before he again spun around and walked towards the horizon. ",
            "Once he was a good distance away, the three women erupted into chatter. Eventually, it was decided that Mailay would travel to the primitive, warring tribes of the west, Sorsia would take the large, luxurious cities of the east, and Rylia would head into the forests of the south and gain control over whatever civilizations she found there.

            "Arsenatio walked decisively north, his arms swaying at his sides. The book he had taken from Sorsia’s golem floated in front of him, bouncing in the air with each step. As he read from the book, he occasionally glanced above it at the horizon to gauge his progress. The desert stretched farther than he had realized it would, as if the land had become incapable of surviving on basic sun and water after millennia of feeding off the magical spring. ",
            "A page in the book slowly turned, and Arsenatio broke into a sly grin as he read on. The ANCIENT_ENEMIES his people had constantly had to fend off, had been tricked into an ambush shortly after he sealed himself away. A myriad of creatures that the ANCIENT_ENEMIES were known to hunt, both large and small, were released into a large, dry savannah. The nomadic tribe settled into the savannah, and the trap was sprung. Agents of his order surrounded the savannah in the middle of the night, and set it ablaze. The fire quickly spread and the cloth and wood structures that the tribe travelled with caught readily. The huge tribe was slaughtered to the last, well armed hunting parties finishing off the few who managed to escape the inferno. ",
            "Arsenatio rubbed at his chin as he considered the ramifications of the conflict. Surely, many of the souls lost that day would have been caught unaware. Many may not have even known they had died, much less the cause of that death. The book snapped closed in front of him, and twirled into a pouch inside his robe. Arsenatio held his hand out, palm up, and whispered into the air. A small flame soon sprouted and hung just above his open hand. ",
            "His voice turned deep and commanding as he addressed the small flame, \"Ignita opticus ANCIENT_ENEMIES!\" ",
            "It stretched upward from his hand and contorted into a ring. Through the ring, the haze of smoke and waves of heat slowly cleared, allowing an image to be seen in the ring of flame. ",
            "At first, it seemed to simply be more flames. As he stared into the image, though, he could make out a shape in the fire. A snake-like form wavered high in the image. ",
            "\"Ignita opticus clarutis\", he spoke again. ",
            "The ring quickly expanded, and the image within began to take a more solid shape. The snake-like form was the neck of the flaming beast. Beneath the flames, a network of human bones made up its body. It’s head was formed from a mass of skulls, each seeming to cackle as they gently swung from side to side. ",
            "Arsenatio reached a hand towards the flaming scene and placed his palm against its surface, \"ANCIENT_ENEMIES, submaticus dominifa\". ",
            "A circle of flame swiftly swung around the long neck and collapsed into it. ",
            "\"You will come in handy in the battle to come, my pet\", Arsenatio whispered to himself as he closed the hand that had summoned the flame into a fist. The ring of fire quickly collapsed in upon itself, disappearing into a whiff of black smoke. "

            "As Mailay walked across the sands, still warming in the fading heat of the sun, she scratched at the blood that was drying on her hands. She had been hoping to find a pool of water to rinse off in for quite some time, but the Sa’erit Jungle had become drier than she had realized. She had been traveling through nothing but dunes of sand since she had set off on her own. ",
            "She scanned the horizon yet again, and was happy to find a slight change of scenery. The grass was just starting to grow a bit, peeking through the sand just slightly. The light brown of the grass was so similar to the sands that it was sometimes difficult to tell where one ended and the other began. As she traveled further, the grass found a better foothold, able to support itself better and stand up well past her calf. She stomped the grass down as she plowed through it, squinting towards the now setting sun. ",
            "Suddenly, she froze, mid-stride. Her gaze swung to a patch of grass off in the distance, to her right. As the ripples of wind flowed across the savannah, that clump of grass seemed to move slightly less than the rest. She spun a sai into her right hand and slowly slipped closer to the spot. She could see the grass where she stared move against the wind for a moment and she was sure. She twirled out her other sai and charged the grass, crouching low as she ran. An arrow shot out of the patch and she dodged to the side, easily removing herself from its path. The archer stood up, his position already compromised, and she could see that he wore a cloak, made from the grass. He pulled another arrow from his cloak, and drew it into his bow, taking his time and aiming carefully. Once she was within five paces, he released his grip and allowed the arrow to fly. She spun her sais up, crossing them in front of her, and caught the arrow in them. The man’s bow swung to his side, and his jaw hung open in unabashed amazement. She took the opportunity to spin around him, holding a sai point to the fleshy area under his chin. Within a moment, he realized his mistake and stood limp, waiting for death to come. ",
            "Instead, he heard her voice, \"I am a sister of the Acacian Mountain. I am sworn to combat a great power that is destined to sweep over these lands and forever change them. I have come here to ask for your people’s allegiance in this fight.\" ",
            "He clenched his teeth as he spoke in a whisper, pulling away from the sai, \"I am just a scout. I can’t pledge our allegiance, but I pledge my own.\" ",
            "Seemingly satisfied, she removed the sai, and spun around the man, taking him in for the first time. He was shorter than her, but his heavy muscles were visible even through the grassy cloak. A quiver was strapped to his chest beneath the cloak, so as not to impede his camouflage, and a short blade hung from his side. His face was painted to match the grass, and the little bit of blonde hair that showed also seemed to match it. All of this made his piercing green eyes stand out. ",
            "\"You would leave your people if they refuse to join me?\" ",
            "The man couldn’t help but stare at Mailay’s tight thighs and the few splatters of blood upon them, \"I would kill my own tribe for a war goddess such as you.\" ",
            "Mailay smiled at the comment, \"Very well. You may be my guard against those that disappear into their surroundings. Now, take me to your leader.\" ",
            "The man pulled back the hood of his cloak, and struck a path to the southwest, Mailay following loosely behind. ",
            "The grass grew even taller as they traveled, and the sun drifted further over the horizon. ",
            "The man stopped in the middle of a field, and scanned his surroundings. Mailay glanced around too, but saw nothing. When she looked back at the man, he had pulled a large patch of grass up from the top of the hill, and was motioning her inside. She eyed him suspiciously, before slipping through the doorway, and down a narrow length of stairs into an underground room. ",
            "Once she reached the bottom, the room opened up a bit. For some reason the room had a soft glow to it. It wasn’t nearly as bright as even the fading light outside, but she was easily able to see her surroundings. The ceilings gave much more clearance than she would have expected, but every pace or so, a large rock pillar held up the ceiling, creating a grid of obstacles that made the room feel smaller. She could see a wall a dragon’s breadth in front of her and two more to either side, but the rest of the room was obscured by the pillars. She turned back to the man just as he slipped past her, motioning her to follow him through the pillars. As she followed, she found a new path around every corner, but he led her easily, turning one direction or another every few paces. ",
            "By the time she found herself in a small room with a woven, grass pad, she felt lost. He set her down on the pad, before rushing off again, mumbling something about setting up a meeting with his leaders. ",
            "Mailay sat in a daze for a moment, attempting to remember the way out in case she needed it. Before too long, she shook her head and gave up on the task, deciding that if it came down to it, she could always just force someone to guide her out. ",
            "As she awoke from her thoughts, she examined her surroundings a bit more. The walls were nothing but dirt, as if the whole place was just dug from the earth. An extra block of dirt was left on the opposite side of the bed, creating a small shelf. On it sat several straight sticks, shards of rock, and a few bird’s feathers for making arrows. Her eyes drifted to the ceiling and she noticed a green, glowing rock set in its center. That must have been what gave off light throughout the cavern. There was no real door to the room, but the entrance curved in such a way as to block the view of those outside. As Mailay laid back and tested the support of the grass pad, a familiar head popped around the entrance. ",
            "\"I’m very sorry, my leaders have already retired for the night, but I’ve already set up an appointment for early tomorrow morning.\" ",
            "She stared up at the man and gave a little huff, \"Oh well, I guess I could use a little rest. It has been a long journey for me. Do you have a place that I could clean up a bit?\" ",
            "The man stumbled briefly as he answered, \"I, uh, Yes. I can run a bath for you if you’d like.\" ",
            "\"That would be wonderful\", she answered as she playfully stretched on the bed, rubbing her legs against one another. ",
            "The man swallowed hard, \"I’ll get that set up and be right back for you.\" ",
            "As the man hurried out of the room, she heard him stumble and run into one of the walls. She smiled to herself and sat back up again, bored with the plain room. ",
            "She stuck her head out the door and looked down the hallway in the direction she had heard him hit a wall. Remembering how little was immediately apparent; she took a few paces down the hallway, and heard the faint sound of water being poured as she approached another opening. Following the sound of the water, she eventually found a pathway blocked with a woven, grass door. ",
            "She raised her hand to knock before realizing the futility in it, and then called out, \"Hello?\" ",
            "The man pulled the grass door aside and peered out, \"Oh, it’s not ready just yet.\" ",
            "\"That’s okay\", Mailay smiled, I just wanted some company while I waited, if that’s okay.\" ",
            "\"Yes, I mean, of course. Please come in\", he pulled the door further open and ushered her in. ",
            "Inside, a small tub was set up in a corner, over a burning fire pit. A nearby well was used to fill the tub and it looked like there was a hole filled with large rocks where the water could be dumped afterwards. On the other side of the room, several clay jars sat on a shelf with labels carved into them. ",
            "\"I thought you’d want fresh water, so I dumped the old water, lit the fire, and have the tub partially full now.\" ",
            "She took a few steps closer to get a better look at the tub, \"Will it be private?\" ",
            "\"Oh… oh yes\", the man said as he scrambled to grab a sign near the clay jars, \"I just need to stick this on the door and you won’t be disturbed.\" ",
            "She reached a hand in to test the water, which was already a bit warm, \"Would you mind putting that up for me now?\" ",
            "The man nodded unquestioningly and pulled back the door, firmly attaching the sign to it. ",
            "She slowly pulled the knots of her forearm armor free as she spoke, \"I don’t think we ever formally introduced ourselves. My name is Mailay.\" ",
            "\"Oh, yes\", the man walked over to the well to continue his work, \"My name is Loki. I am the head guard for our village here.\" ",
            "She pulled the armor free and set it on the ground, far from the fire, \"It seems we have a lot in common then. You see, I’m basically the lead warrior among my sisters.\" She rubbed her bare arm, happy to be free of the restriction, and then began working on the other arm. ",
            "Loki smirked, as he poured another bucket full of water into the tub, \"I appreciate the comparison, but I saw what you did with that arrow I shot at you. You were able to catch it from only a few paces away. I’ve never seen anyone move that fast.\" ",
            "She pulled at the knots on the back of her knee-high leg armor next, \"I’ve had quite a bit of time to refine my skills. You might be surprised what you can do with practice.\" ",
            "He set the bucket down, satisfied with the water level in the tub, \"I guess, but I’ve been working at disappearing into the grass since I was three years old. Yet, shortly after you came into view, you locked in on my position and started charging.\" ",
            "She nodded, \"I had the aid of powerful magic to give me time to hone my abilities, and one of the things I studied was how to detect things that are amiss. I’m sorry I charged at you right away, but my task is too important to let myself walk into a trap.\" ",
            "He breathed a grievous breath out as he looked through the various clay jars and picked out two, \"There is no need for you to apologize. I would have tried to work things out without the use of my bow, but my village has been in a conflict with a nearby camp. Several of our people have lost their lives in this fight, and we’ve all been a little on edge lately.\" ",
            "She set the first metal boot on her stack and started working on the second, \"Tension can cloud even the most tempered man’s judgment. Try not to be so hard on yourself.\" ",
            "The man turned with the jars he had picked out and set to sprinkling them over the water, trying not to stare to much at the new skin that Mailay kept revealing, \"I guess I can take my work a bit too seriously. Ever since my sister was killed a few years ago, I’ve made it my personal goal to ensure the safety of everyone in this village. It began as a constructive way to deal with the grief, but I’ve had trouble learning to relax and enjoy myself between my shifts.\" ",
            "She pulled the last boot free and wiggled her toes, \"Once you’re done with that, can you help me unfasten the rest of this armor. It’s a bit difficult for me to reach.\" She twirled out her sais and stuck them in the wall near the tub, so that they would remain within reach. ",
            "Loki swallowed hard as he set the jars back in their spot, \"An… Anything I can do to make you more comfortable.\" ",
            "She pulled her short, golden hair off to the side as he walked over and untied the top knot. He slowly worked the straps loose, until he was able to pull the armor apart, folding open a hinge along each side. The underside of the armor was lined with a very smooth fabric, and padded with something incredibly soft. As his eyes drifted down the armor, he realized that her back was now completely bare except for a thin, leather strap that cushioned the seam in the armor. He froze, unsure of what he should do. ",
            "Sensing his apprehension, she slowly pulled the armor free and stooped down to set it on top of the other pieces. As she stood, she turned around to face him, and closed the distance between them quickly. She whispered in to his ear, \"I think we both need to take this opportunity to wash up, release a little tension, and relax a bit.\" ",
            "She pulled back, kissed him on the cheek and gracefully climbed into the, now steaming, bath water. Within moments, he had shed his clothing and was climbing in to join her. "

            "Sorsia looked off to the sands of the east from the seat she had created on top of the massive golem. It was now much shorter and wider than before, with a caged compartment holding all of the books she had gathered; all but one. Fine Cloth and Gems of the Eastern Countries sat open in her hand. The golem was traveling a bit slower than she would be on foot, but this way she could bring all her books with her and get a bit of time to read them. It looked like they were just within sight of the mountains of Acacia, far to the southern horizon. She soon became bored with the views and once again got lost in the book. ",
            "Eventually, she absorbed all the information the book had to offer and closed it with a snap. Her hand touched the rock under her and a slit opened up to the cage below. She dropped the book into it and then the slit resealed itself. ",

            "Rylia was beginning to get really bored. She had been traveling south all day, with nothing but her walking corpse for entertainment. She was just getting to the point that the line of green that had been on the horizon was forming into a bunch of trees. At least now a change of scenery was within sight. The Sa’erit jungle she remembered was actually fun to travel through, with something scurrying around at every turn. The desert it had become was just as dull close up as it appeared from on top of the mountain peak. ",
            "Excited by the possibility of something new, she broke into a run, her giant sword swinging back and forth in its scabbard in rhythm with her strides. As she got closer to the forest, she could tell that a short cliff separated the desert from it. She pulled her sword from her back and lifted it into the air. A few paces from the cliff, she struck the ground hard and used the resistance to flip herself over her blade. She arced up, over the edge of the cliff, and landed solidly on her feet, sword in hand. The body behind her easily leapt up onto the cliff beside her. She carefully replaced her blade in its scabbard before taking in the new scenery. ",
            "The trees were sparse, but still held their secrets within their weaving branches. Off in the distance, to the east, she could see several plumes of white smoke against the darkening sky. A smile spread wide across her face as she realized she would have a real place to sleep for the night. ",
            "She began working her way through the trees, checking over her shoulders periodically and eyeing the branches suspiciously. ",
            "By the time she reached a clearing, the sky was quite dark. She could see the town just ahead over a wall about as tall as she was. Remembering Arsenatio’s words about gathering willing followers, she decided to follow the wall south until she found an entrance. It took a bit longer than she expected, but she found large wooden doors locked tight. She ordered her pet to stay hidden while she looked around inside, and then lifted her helmet free. ",
            "She knocked on the doors hard, and was surprised to receive a quick answer. A voice spoke from a narrow slit near the edge of the door, \"Not so loud! What business do you have here?\" ",
            "Rylia stared at the hole, \"I’ve come seeking a place to stay for the night and an ally in my cause.\" ",
            "She could see a pair of deeply inset eyes peer through the hole at her, \"Welcome to Malfrum, Miss.\" ",
            "Within a few moments, she could hear metal twisting against itself, followed by the creaking of the large doors opening. When she approached the opening, the man’s head popped through, eyeing her armor. ",
            "\"Let me show you to our inn. We offer good rates, soft beds, and a place to wash up a bit from your travels.\" ",
            "She nodded to the man as she slipped through the door. As soon as she was through, he sealed the doors and slid the lock back into place. All she could make out in the darkness was one big street, simple buildings and narrow alleys lining it on either side. There was only one light, a torch hanging out above the inn sign. ",
            "\"I should be able to find my way to the inn on my own, thanks.\" ",
            "\"As you wish\", the man stated simply, disappearing back into darkness. ",
            "She walked towards the light and slipped into the doorway, finding a small, dimly lit room. A large, older man sat behind the counter, looking through a small, leather-bound book. When he noticed her, he set the book beneath the edge of the counter. ",
            "\"Need a room, miss?\" ",
            "She took e few steps to the counter and nodded, setting a thin, gold coin on the counter. ",
            "The man’s eyebrow rose as he picked up the coin and tested its hardness, \"Room number six is just up those stairs. How long are you planning on staying?\" ",
            "Rylia thought for a moment, \"It depends on how things go, but probably a few days.\" ",
            "The large man grabbed a key from underneath the counter and set it on the counter, \"We only ask that you don’t start any fires in the room. There have been a few accidents over the years.\" ",
            "Rylia nodded, grabbed the key and disappeared up the stairs. ",
            "The room was small, but had all the essentials: an overstuffed bed, a sturdy wooden table, a pump attached to a small tub, and a sturdy lock on the door. Rylia locked the door behind her and started to stack her armor in a heap on the table, stripping down to the clingy cloth shirt and pants she wore underneath. The desert had caused her to sweat quite a bit and she suddenly found herself very thirsty. She worked on the pump a bit until clean water poured into the basin, then stuck her whole head into it and gulped down the water. ",
            "Once she’d had her fill, she filled the basin again and used a small cloth she found nearby to wash her face and hands. The cool water felt so good against her skin that she pulled the rest of her clothes free and wiped herself from head to toe. Once she was finished cleaning up, she soaked her cloth undergarments in the tub and scrubbed at them briefly before hanging them up to dry. She realized then, that she was getting goose bumps in the cool air of the room, but still, it felt good to be truly alone again, after so many years of constant company. She began to understand how her sister could have run away. ",
            "She pulled back the heavy blankets of the bed and flopped onto the white sheets, quickly replacing the blankets. At first, the sheets were cold against her bare skin, causing her to shiver and clench the blankets close. After a little while though, the heat built up and Rylia drifted soundly to sleep. "

            "Ekosa slowly opened her eyes and rubbed the sleep from them. For once, Walf was still curled up sleeping near her. She sat up and looked around in the dim light that the sun managed to shoot over the horizon. Thundrax and Natalia slept close to one another, Pyror curled up between them. Feakew was curled up against Walf’s fur, almost out of sight behind him. ",
            "She quietly got to her feet and stretched, rubbing the lingering sleep from her eyes. ",
            "She stared at the small cliff that stood between their camp and the waterfall, noticing that the waterfall itself was out of sight from this position. A few, groggy steps later, she found herself at the bank of the shallow lake, staring into the pure water as it poured over the falls. It looked so inviting. She knelt down and tested the water with her hand, finding it much warmer than she had expected it to be. The water must have been naturally heated from a spring. That would also answer the question of where the water was flowing from, which had been nagging at her. ",
            "After a moment of thought, she decided to seize this opportunity to feel clean again. Judging from how long the others had slept before, she should have plenty of time to do it privately. Once the decision had been made, she wasted no time in untying her boots and setting them on top of her carefully folded cloak on a large rock nearby. She stepped into the warm water, and walked further in until the water reached the lowest edge of her wumpus-hide shorts. She then took a deep breath and dove in, kicking herself towards the fall. She came up just behind it, in a small pocket of rock, and found two large slabs of rock she could use as footholds. She let the water fall onto her head, washing the bits of dirt, sap, and tree bark from her hair. Once her hair was sufficiently cleaned, she worked her way down, rubbing at stubborn spots on her hands and elbows. ",
            "Eventually, she felt sufficiently clean and again dove into the water, climbing out on the opposite side she had come in. She climbed the mound to the top of the waterfall and found a large, flat rock. She laid down there and dried herself in the rising sunlight. Her eyes closed and she went over the events of the day before in her mind, considering the reactions and decisions of everyone she had been traveling with. As she lay there, a large shadow came between her and the sunlight. Her eyes snapped open just as Walf’s big tongue slobbered up the side of her face. ",
            "\"Awww, Walf!\", she protested, \"I just got cleaned up.\" ",
            "Walf looked a bit confused at the flavor, and sniffed at her stomach, prompting a fit of laughter from Ekosa as she struggled to keep the massive head away. ",
            "\"That’s it\", she worked out between fits of laughter, \"You’re getting a bath.\" ",
            "Walf pulled away and shook his head decidedly, avoiding her eyes. ",
            "\"Now, come on, Walf\", she argued, \"you haven’t had a bath in a few months now and this water is nice and warm.\" ",
            "Ekosa moved a hand to get up and Walf ran for a patch of trees, disappearing in moments. ",
            "Ekosa just laughed and climbed down to where she had set her cloak and boots. She carefully fit the boots back on, tying firm knots so they wouldn’t shift as she jumped through the trees. ",
            "\"Good Morning\", Feakew called as he rounded the cliff. ",
            "Ekosa glanced over to him, \"You’re up early.\" ",
            "\"Ya, I guess\", Feakew smiled, \"My pillow got up and left me.\" ",
            "Ekosa shook her head, \"That’s how he first trained me to get up early, ya know\" ",
            "\"He trained you?\", Feakew asked as he leaned against the rock wall. ",
            "\"Ya\", Ekosa smirked, \"About the only thing I’ve ever taught him to do was take a bath, and I can’t even seem to get that out of him at times.\" ",
            "Feakew nodded, \"So, did you make any progress with your abilities yesterday?\" ",
            "Ekosa looked around and found a pile of leaves on the ground. She puckered her lips and blew into the air. As she did, a big gust of wind built up behind her and scattered the leaves, tossing some into the air, and others along the ground until they ran into something. ",
            "\"Wow\", Feakew said, \"so you can control the wind. That’s amazing.\" ",
            "Ekosa nodded, \"I noticed it when this branch kept falling into the line of my shot. How about you?\" ",
            "Feakew pointed to the scratch that used to be a wound in his side, \"I figured out how to heal myself a bit better. I was also able to seal up Walf’s wound a bit last night.\" ",
            "\"Impressive\", Ekosa stated simply. ",
            "Without warning, Walf landed with a light thud on the ground behind Feakew. He spun around in shock before realizing who had made the noise. ",
            "\"I can see how he would have a lot to teach\", Feakew muttered as he ruffled the fur on Walf’s head. "

The elder dwarves I traveled with ordered the expedition to stay away from it. Still, I tried to sneak away one night and get to it. I was caught by one of our own and bound until we had traveled well past the forest. To this day, I can’t explain why I was so enthralled by it. Could those woods hold my gem?\" ",

            "\"Then we must travel there and search\", Feakew admitted. ",

            "Natalia looked the group over once again, \"I should be able to carry Thundrax and Feakew easily enough, but you won’t be able to keep up with a dragon easily.\" ",
            "A smile formed across Ekosa’s face, \"On rugged terrain, you may be right, but Walf is quicker than I would have ever imagined. One thing I learned early, do not underestimate his stealth or his speed just because of his size. Besides, we’ll travel faster than we ever could on foot.\" ",

He flailed his arms in the air and managed to shift his weight back onto the bed before flopping back down, breathing heavily. After a time staring at the ceiling, he carefully stood up beside the bed, and slipped his pants on. He could hear pans cluttering in the kitchen beyond the door, and he wandered out towards the sounds. The wooden chair squeaked in protest as he flopped his weight into it, scratching his chin absently. ",

His wife, Rashira, bounded over to greet him with a kiss and pulled out a chair for him to have a seat. He fell into the chair and found a small pamphlet in front of him. The front cover was labeled Reguria’s Rebirth. Below the title, he found two articles about vicious crimes that had taken place within the walls of the city. After scanning over them, he turned the page and found a large article about the Lumarians and the plots they were enacting against their nation. On the next page, he found yet another article that flowed around a large image of himself. The article explained the heroic plans he was trying to put into place to protect the nation from the turmoil it faced from both within and without. He felt a great swell of pride at the article, and turned to the back page expectantly, where he found his announcement for the contest beautifully laid out. ",

As he looked into the clear sky, he could see the sun nearly at the peak of its daily rounds. He clumsily locked the door, and hurried to his first destination, the furniture shop, to check on their progress. He knocked hard on the door, and was met after a time with the middle-aged man in the apron he had met before. ",

It’s a little difficult to work with because of its incredible durability, but it really is the best thing we found for this. The spokes are cut to fit tightly together and we add a layer of this liquid we’ve distilled from trawasp saliva. It’s extremely sticky at first, but after it dries, it makes the spokes nearly unbreakable.\" The man looked around briefly before hurrying on to another station, absently motioning Griak to follow. ",
            "\"We are bending the wood over the spokes to make the wheels over here. We tried doubling their thickness, but it didn’t seem durable enough, so we added a few extra layers to it. We’ve been varying the position of the ends too in order to avoid creating weak spots. We tried skeerwood here, at first, but it’s very difficult to bend and it tends to crack more easily that way. We ended up using ancient pine. It’s flexible enough to wrap quickly and it should make the ride a little less jolting.\" Again the man glanced around, and hurried around another corner. Griak stopped for a moment to appreciate the craftsmanship of the wheel before him, and had to run a bit to keep from losing the man. ",

It was wide enough to fit two men, lying side by side. A hinged door on top of either side allowed for easy entry into the nearly completely enclosed cockpit. A wide window in front allowed the men inside to see out. On top of the vehicle, four curved pockets, each complete with a pair of handles, formed the simple seats that would allow it to carry extra combatants. ",
            "\"It looks wonderful, but what do you plan on for movement? How will those inside fight?\" ",
            "\"Oh\", the man in the apron stuttered, \"I forgot to tell you the best part. I’ve been working with several of the local guilds. The mages have been developing a new source of power. I don’t understand it completely, but it draws upon the energy of a person and changes that into a powerful force that I have harnessed to move these vehicles.

            "Mailay smiled and pressed her lips gently to Loki’s, \"Very good. I’d like to meet with them as soon as possible, but I’m getting pretty hungry.\" ",
            "Loki nodded enthusiastically, \"I forgot to mention that. The elders have a variety of local foods available for you to choose from while you all talk about your proposal.\" ",
            "\"Lead the way\", she replied simply. ",
            "Loki blazed a path through the maze of columns, eventually winding down another staircase. Once he had made it to the bottom of the stairs, Loki directed Mailay down a hallway with woven emblems hanging from the walls. ",
            "\"You’re not coming?\", she asked in confusion. ",

            "Loki nodded before walking down the decorated hallway, \"I will not disappoint you.\" ",
            "He pulled back a woven door at the end of the hall and held it aside while Mailay slipped into the room. ",
            "Inside the room, the floor was lined with a woven, grass rug. In the center of the room, a large, stone table held a variety of food, from roasted meats to boiled roots. Three, simple stone chairs were empty in front of the table. Behind it, five older men sat in ornately-carved stone chairs, all wearing finely woven and died robes. ",
            "\"I’m glad you could join us\", the man in the center spoke clearly, then noticed a figure still in the doorway; \"You can go now, Loki.\" ",
            "\"Loki is my new personal guard and I will have him present for this meeting\", Mailay broke in. ",
            "The man’s eyebrows rose in surprise, \"Very well. We’ve heard that you are gathering allies for a great battle that you think is coming. What more can you tell us about your intentions?\" ",
            "She had already begun to gather several tempting dishes onto an empty, stone plate, \"I’d like to train your men to battle the great threat that is coming. Once I have trained them, they will be much more deadly in battle. Until the threat I have mentioned makes itself known, you are free to use their new talents as you wish. However, once the force appears, we will need all of the forces of the allied countries to stand against them. This will not be an easy fight, but the consequence for loss will be great for this entire world, including your people.\" ",
            "The man interlocked his finger in front of himself and played with his upper lip, \"I’m sure you can understand that we are skeptical of turning our forces over to you when we have seen no evidence of this threat you speak of.\" ",
            "Mailay was busy sampling the different dishes, \"You would retain full control of your forces, if that is what you prefer. As for the proof that a threat lies around the corner, I have only the prophecy that drove my sisters and I to disappear from this world for 500 years of training. Surely, living in this labyrinth of twists and turns, you can understand that a threat is not always visible until after it’s too late.\" ",
            "The man in the center nodded slowly, \"If you will excuse us for a moment, we should have your answer shortly.\" ",
            "Mailay loaded up her plate with more of the dishes laid out on the table, then left the room, Loki only a few steps behind. ",
            "Once out of earshot of the elders, Loki spoke softly, \"I’ve never seen anyone speak that boldly to the elder’s before.\" ",
            "\"This task is too important for me to be timid\", she smiled back at him and pointed to her plate, \"What is this one called? It’s wonderful.\" ",
            "\"That looks like Wumpus meat baked with a special blend of spices.\" ",
            "\"Don’t you think it’s delicious?\", she asked. ",
            "He bit his lower lip while he thought for a moment, \"I’ve actually never been able to eat it fresh. The guards get the dried leftovers and steamed roots.\" ",
            "\"Really?!\", Mailay mused before lifting a forkful to his lips, \"Try some. It is truly wonderful.\" ",
            "Cautiously, Loki took a bite of the steaming meat, \"Wow\", he muttered around the food, \"This is much better fresh.\" ",
            "\"I can’t believe you’re not allowed to eat this type of thing. That’s going to have to change now that you’re my guard.\" ",

            "She threw her tired eyes open, desperately trying to take in what was going on. The golem had stopped moving, meaning they must have reached their destination, the great city of RICHES. Towers rose up on each side of the wide street, each with a large sign advertising the products; fine cloth, jewelry, and custom made boots. ",

            "\"I see\", the woman spoke, her smile beginning to fade, \"then I will need the 35 gold pieces up front.\" ",
            "Sorsia’s mind raced and she glanced around, noticing a small leather bag peeking from around the corner of the desk. She stretched the fingers of her left hand as she walked towards another wall of bracelets, \"I have the money with me for occasions such as this.\" ",

She wrapped herself up in the blanket and then rolled out of bed, blanket and all. She carefully stuck an arm out and grabbed the shirt and pants she had been drying overnight, then quickly sucked them inside to get warm. Once they’d had some time to warm up a bit, she contorted under the blankets, managing to get her clothes back on without losing too much warmth. She then waddled over to the tub, drew some fresh water and rinsed the sleep from her eyes, slowly letting the blanket slip down a bit. ",
            "Finally, she felt awake. She tossed the blanket back on the bed and walked over to where she had stripped her heavy armor. Panic washed over her as she saw nothing but an empty patch of floor. She spun to the wall her sword had been leaning against and found it also missing. Her mind raced, coming back to the night before and the man that had eyed her so intently. Furious, she flung the door open and raced down the stairs to the front desk, where the large man sat in a chair, studying his leather-bound book. ",

            "She followed close behind him, wary of being caught off guard again. Once they reached the bottom, the man kicked a switch and a network of lights lit up the room. It was huge, with a variety of wares piled up everywhere. Rylia quickly spotted her armor and hurried over to it, working as fast as she could to fit everything together right. Strapping her sword across her back, she turned her attention to the man once again, \"Mind if I look around a bit?\" ",
            "The man simply fell into a slump and rubbed at his throat. ",
            "There was a system of cages along the back wall, each with a well used bed and a huddled lump of a woman in one of its corner. Along her right, all manner of armor and weapons were stacked up, sorted into piles. Along her left wall, a rickety system of shelves held dozens of jars, each with a symbol and a label. There seemed to be everything from poisons, to antidotes, to hallucinogenic drugs on that wall. She spun to the back wall and found a wall of portraits, each with a bounty listed below it. As she turned back to the man, he tried to slip up the ladder. ",

Walk right into my store asking for an engagement ring and then make off with my money. And these guards! They aren’t even willing to do a proper search to get my money back. If they skim a fee off the top again, I swear I’m going above their heads. I don’t care if they are related to the Rikoffs.\" ",

The door to enter was a good palm’s width thick and had a railing inside to easily barricade it further. Inside, rows of desks held official looking men working on various papers. Behind them, there was another office on the right, with another thick door, and a series of cells on the left. ",

            "Sorsia smiled and slipped past the guard, slipping into the room and shutting the door behind her. The office was surprisingly spacious, with a sky light to let the light in. There walls were covered in bookcases and notes pinned to the walls. Across the back wall, an enormous man sat behind an equally large desk. On his desk sat a box of pastries and a platter of meats, along with a few papers. His scruffy, red beard and the overdone shoulder pads of his uniform made him seem even larger. ",

She stood and scanned the rest of the camp, finding the patch of trees she had expected to find on the opposite side. She decided that she must have just gotten mixed up on where she set up camp. ",
            "Ekosa stretched again and started to cook breakfast, tossing a few scraps to Walf. ",
            "As the scent of the food rose into the air, Feakew opened his eyes, rolling up onto his feet. While he began packing his things, Natalia also woke, shaking Thundrax to life as she did. ",
            "The camp was quiet while Ekosa finished breakfast, with the odd sound of a pack being rolled. ",
            "The group continued their silence into their meal until Thundrax finally broke it, \"I’m sorry guys. I don’t know why this thing is proving so difficult to find. It does feel like we’re getting closer, though.\" ",
            "Feakew nodded, \"Don’t worry about it. We all know you’re not trying to do this.\" ",
            "As soon as everyone was done eating, Ekosa found the tree next to the next path and lead the way. ",
            "\"Ekosa\", Thundrax called, \"It feels like it’s coming from this way.\" ",
            "She turned to him, confused, \"That’s the way we came from.\" ",
            "Thundrax shrugged. ",
            "Shaking her head, Ekosa walked to Thundrax and picked a path back the way she had come. ",
            "\"It’s possible that his gem has become mobile, like Walf and Pyror\", Natalia pointed out. ",
            "\"True\", Thundrax admitted, \"But I still can’t get over the fact that I feel like I’m already in it somehow. I mean, it’s definitely strongest where we are going, but…I don’t know\" ",
            "The group continued to wind their way through ever-thickening vegetation, adjusting course periodically according to Thundrax’s advice. ",
            "As the sun made its way directly overhead, Ekosa called back from the brush, \"I think I may have found something up here.\" ",
            "The group walked into a clearing up ahead and found a stump covered in a mass of vines. Sticking up through the vines, a staff stood with a small, yellow gem at its tip. Thundrax climbed up onto the stump and pulled the staff free, revealing another small, yellow gem on the other end. He jumped down from the stump joyfully and stared into the gems, one after the other. ",
            "\"Congratulations\", Natalia smiled at him. ",
            "Pyror stared at the staff questioningly, \"Pyror no know.\" ",
            "Thundrax nodded, \"There’s something not right about this. I still feel drawn to something else. ",
            "Thundrax took a few steps past the stump and the vines under his feet began to move. He froze for a moment and looked back at the confused group, \"Did you see that?\" ",
            "He got several nods as his answer, but decided to take a few more steps to see down another path a bit better. As he did, the vine grew up around his foot, locking him in place. ",
            "\"Okay, this is definitely weird.\" ",
            "Feakew walked towards Thundrax and the vines seemed to shift again. He stood as far back as he could and cut the vines free from around Thundrax’s leg. Smiling, Thundrax sprinted towards the trail. As he did, a vine shot down from above him and swept around his waist, pulling him too high for Feakew to reach. ",
            "\"I’m going to try to cut you down\", Ekosa called to him, \"Run back to us when you get to the ground.\" ",
            "Within a moment, Ekosa had fired an arrow at the vine, slicing it clean through. Thundrax fell to the ground with a thud, but quickly got up and threw himself away from his friends, shouting, \"It’s so close!\" ",
            "When he hit the ground, the vines began spiraling in on themselves. They pulled away from the tree stump and down from trees overhead. It released its grip on him and all balled up into one giant mass. ",
            "\"Please\", he whispered, \"You must help us… help me, in this upcoming battle.\" ",
            "The vines slowly sunk back, revealing a delicate wooden face. When it spoke, its voice flowed like the wind, \"Are you truly the one I’ve waited so long for?\" ",
            "Thundrax licked his lips, \"I have no reason to think that I am worthy of you, but the Sisters of Acacia have already awoken to battle a great evil and we must assist them.\" ",
            "The face pulled forward on its bed of vines to meet that of Thundrax, \"You serve the sisters?\" ",
            "He struggled to explain the situation, \"No, they actually rejected our assistance, but we are committed to protecting this world from that which threatens to destroy it.\" ",
            "The face stared deep into Thundrax’s eyes for a long time, as if looking for something in them. ",
            "\"I will assist you\", the face spoke as the vines curled into themselves once again, shrinking into the mask until they revealed a woman’s gentle wooden body. ",
            "\"Thank you\", Thundrax smiled. ",
            "\"Nakomis?\", Pyror broke in. ",
            "The wooden woman directed her attention to the small dragon, \"Pyror? Is that you?\" ",
            "\"You change much.\" ",
            "The woman nodded, \"My energy has been infused into the life of this forest.\" ",
            "Thundrax’s eyes grew wide, \"That’s why I felt you all around me.\" ",
            "The woman nodded again, \"Everyone is together now?\" ",
            "Pyror nodded enthusiastically. ",
            "A devious smirk spread across the wooden face, \"We can finally begin.\" ",
            "\"Begin what?\", Natalia questioned. ",
            "\"The beginning of the end\", Nakomis answered, her gaze moving first to the tree line on their right, then to the left. Five huge golems stepped into the opening on each side. Their arms and legs were massive tree trunks, each joint connected by a mass of thick, brown vines. On top of each was a small, cackling, wooden face, scarred from countless battles. Nakomis stepped back out of the clearing, vines crisscrossing between the trees on all sides, locking the group inside. ",
            "\"Nakomis no protector\", Pyror spit out with contempt, \"No now.\" ",
            "Her laughter echoed through the forest, and the masks on the golems spoke as one, \"Your kind has enslaved and murdered mine for far too long! You will not stop the change that is coming, the shift in power I have waited so long for!\" ",
            "\"No!\", Natalia screamed, \"The enemy the prophecy spoke of, the one that will ravage this land, will not spare the trees any more than any other. We fight this battle to keep you from harm as much as the rest of this world.\" ",
            "\"Don’t try to talk your way out of this\", a golem to the right spoke as it smashed its massive fists together, sending a small crack splintering up one of the forearms. ",
            "Natalia tried to calm herself with a deep breath and swallowed hard, \"We are not your enemies in this, but we will fight you if it comes to it. This battle is too important to let ourselves be defeated prematurely.\" ",
            "A flourish of magic left a large, red dragon standing between five of the golems and the rest of the group, a smaller dragon ready to pounce at her side. The wooden faces all wore a sinister smile as the trees circling the clearing took a step back, and a network of vines knitted a roof for the arena. Ekosa had jumped onto Walf’s back and had an arrow ready to release into one of the masks. Thundrax stood in his wide stance, charging up the power his bones held. Feakew held his axe in his hands, staring into its gem. ",
            "As the golems rushed the group as one, Ekosa released her arrow. It stuck solidly in the mask, unnoticed by the masks owner. Feakew released his power into another and one leg burst into splinters, leaving three more tree trunks charging at him. Natalia and Pyror released huge balls of fire which enveloped one of the golems, but didn’t slow its charge. ",
            "\"Nakomis!\", Feakew spoke in a deep, powerful voice, his attention still wrapped within the gem. ",
            "The golems froze within arms-reach of the group and their masks stared at Feakew. ",
            "\"I was there when the order attacked you. I was there when they tainted your water supplies and introduced ravenous pests into your boughs. I’ve seen these people’s vicious slaughters of each other for the sake of land and power. I’ve seen how carelessly they destroy the life that grows over centuries, how they warp that life to suit their needs. I understand that you want to lend your power to that cause. Search your mind for our purpose. We were made to help four people calm a great spike of power that would threaten all life. A force like that will not allow the life that grows over centuries to flourish. You know this. Join our cause. Lend your power to these four, and when we calm the spike that threatens all life, we will rearrange the balance of power in this world. We will give a voice to the life that grows over centuries.\" ",
            "The masks rattled atop their golems and Nakomis struggled to hold her head in her hands as she battled herself behind the veil of vines. One after another, the golems smashed their massive fists into their masks, crushing them into splinters and leaving the golems to fall into a heap on the ground. Slowly, the vines receded and Nakomis stepped back into the opening, \"You really think these four can do all that?\" ",
            "Feakew moved as if held up by strings, staring into her eyes, \"The alternative is trusting a power hungry dictator to turn away from the greatest control he’s ever known.\" ",
            "Nakomis turned to Thundrax and kneeled before him, \"If you will have me, I’d be honored to act as your guardian.\" ",
            "Thundrax stared around at the rest of the group, getting a nod from each before he returned his attention to her, \"We need all the help we can get.\" "

            "Griak beamed as he examined the new maps that had been made. Reguria was now nearly ten times the size it had been when the first Regurian Reborn had been released. The reformation program was working better than he had ever imagined it would. With each new victory, he found new resources, new soldiers, and new ideas to strengthen his forces. The pamphlets his wife had designed turned the bitter battles he had expected into wide arms of welcome on several occasions. ",

            "With a long sigh, Griak stood from his desk and walked outside. The sun had already faded beyond the horizon, but there was still a gentle haze of light clinging in the air. His shoes echoed as he walked down the empty hallways. Eventually, he reached the thick, iron door that his purpose lay behind. ",
            "He knocked hard on the door three times. He took a few slow, deep breaths while he awaited a response, met with nothing but the lingering echoes through the hallway. Slowly, their gentle hum disappeared from the air, and a narrow slit in the door slid open, allowing a pair of cloudy, white eyes to peer at Griak. He avoided their gaze, as he always did, and waited for them to set to their task. The eyes backed away and slammed the slit shut before clanging three locks free, and swinging the door open. The small room was as dark as he cared to remember, with narrow, stone stairs set against the far wall, sinking into a dark abyss. ",
            "The door swung shut behind him with a solid thud, and he could hear the locks being once again slammed shut. He took another deep breath to calm himself and waited for the form to lead him down into the blackness. ",
            "A woman soon appeared in front of him, all beauty robbed of her by birth and a hard life. She was massive and would have easily stood taller than him if her hunched back hadn’t curved her frame downward, setting her face even with his own. The part of her hair he could see past the blood and flesh that clung to her was a dingy grey and grew only in clumps on top of her disfigured skull. Her face sagged over her haunting white eyes. Her nose had long ago been removed, leaving only two small holes on her face. Her scarred, cracked lips seemed permanently set in a grim expression. Hairs grew in clumps from a network of growths along her left cheek and continued down into her masculine jaw line. She wore a gore-colored cloak over the rest of her frame, but her overdeveloped muscles still shone through. A thick leather belt was synched around her waist, from which a well-used curved sword and thick bladed mace swung as she moved. Her massive, gloved hands swung just below her knees as she stepped down the stairs, muttering a phrase he couldn’t understand. ",
            "The dim light from the room above went out and a soft glow lit the stairwell. She took the stairs two at a time, muttering something different every few strides to swap torch lights. He had some trouble keeping her pace, but pushed himself onward, not wanting to be left to dodge the large cracks and rubble that the stairway held in darkness. ",
            "He arrived at the base of the stairs winded, his chest burning. The room the stairs opened into was huge. Cages hung from the ceiling and all sorts of blood-encrusted iron devices littered the floor. A wrack to his left held a myriad of more mobile devices intended to bring about agony. ",

            "\"I’m ready\" Feakew announced as he walked into the center of the arena. Ekosa smiled and hopped onto Walf’s back, pulling her bow from her back. They each faced one another in the center of the arena, a dragon’s breadth away. ",
            "Without warning, Walf darted to the side, weaving across the arena while Feakew spun to follow his position. Ekosa had an arrow knocked, keeping Feakew in her sights as Walf moved. She took a deep breath and blew it out in a steady stream, causing a large gust to push against Feakew’s stout form. He crouched down against the force of it to hold his ground and Ekosa released her arrow. It flew through the air and struck Feakew solidly in the thigh. He gritted his teeth as it sunk into his flesh, and then quickly pulled it free. He kept his eyes locked on Ekosa and Walf as he placed a hand on the wound, quickly sealing it up to a small scratch. When Walf bounded in close, Feakew saw his chance; he spun around using his axe to give him momentum and met Walf as he landed. Walf quickly jumped to the side, but Feakew followed just behind, twirling the axe around him to keep his momentum going in the right direction. Each time Walf bounded, Feakew lost a little ground, until he eventually gave in, panting while he leaned on the mighty axe, \"I… can’t… keep up.\" ",
            "Walf slowed down and allowed Ekosa to jump down, \"I told you Walf’s quick, though you had me a little worried a few times there.\" ",
            "Feakew nodded as he calmed his breathing down a bit, \"I just can’t do much unless I first close the distance. I need a way to catch you more easily.\" ",
            "Ekosa nodded, \"How does that wound look? I got a pretty good shot in.\" ",
            "Feakew smiled and showed off the scratch on his thigh, \"I barely noticed.\" ",
            "Feakew and Ekosa turned to get an opinion from the others and found Natalia and Thundrax lying on the ground, lips locked. ",
            "\"What did you think, Nakomis?\", Feakew asked. ",
            "Nakomis looked up from the spot she was rooted too, \"You can never win, Feakew, unless you find a way to fight her advantage. You have to slow her down somehow. Walf, you should never have come as close as you did to Feakew. You must stretch the distance advantage you have over him as much as you can. Ekosa, sometimes quantity is more important than quality. You had several opportunities to get more shots in, but you waited for a perfect one.\" ",
            "Natalia had finally realized what was going on and sat up to join the conversation, Thundrax following her lead, \"I’m not sure I agree with quantity over quality. You only have so many arrows with you, after all.\" ",
            "\"Hey\", Feakew argued, \"She beat me easily. You think we could focus on ways to help give me a chance instead of giving her advice on how to beat me more easily?\" ",
            "Ekosa chuckled to herself as she turned to Feakew, \"We need to find you a decent bow or something. Anyway, it’s your turn now, Natalia and Thundrax.\" ",
            "Natalia smiled and transformed into a mouse. She scurried to the center of the arena, a red mouse following close behind. ",
            "\"You’re gonna fight me as a mouse?\", Thundrax asked as he rocked to his feet and took his place in the arena. Nakomis uprooted herself and trotted to catch up behind him. ",
            "The four stood a dragon’s breadth apart, remaining perfectly still for a moment. The two small mice dug their claws into the earth and sprinted across the distance. Nakomis immediately jumped back and exploded in a mass of vines. Her body disappeared beneath the bundle before they began slithering across the arena. Thundrax clapped his hands together and concentrated as he released a shifting ball of energy. The ball darted out towards the red mouse, but it easily jumped out of the way. The brown mouse had almost reached Feakew when she met with her first vine. She leaped it easily, and scurried under a second. Feakew was busy with the red mouse. He darted the ball of lightning after it, but it seemed to dodge away every time. He finally got an angle on it and smashed it with the low-voltage sparing ball. It twitched in shock, then flopped over playfully, transforming back into a staff. Feakew was smiling at his victory when he felt a small body scurry up his leg. He tried to catch it but it dodged around his body before transforming in a cloud of magic and biting Feakew in the small of his back. She transformed into the mouse again and scurried out of his robe. Nakomis swung vines at the tiny creature, but couldn’t seem to keep up. ",
            "\"I assume you could have injected a deadly poison with that bite\", Feakew announced, rubbing the spot on his back, \"We give up.\" ",
            "Nakomis stopped, and pulled the vines away from her face, \"I haven’t been beaten yet.\" ",
            "Pyror changed back into a small dragon, \"Protect lose. Protector lose.\" ",
            "Natalia scurried back to her dress and took her natural form again, \"Besides, the best way for me to fight you would be dragon’s fire and I can’t really scale that back for training.\" ",
            "Nakomis collapsed her vines down on themselves, \"I tried to protect you, Thundrax, but they were so tiny and quick.\" ",
            "\"I know\", Thundrax smiled, \"I can’t believe I was beaten by a pair of mice either. Can you heal up this bite, Feakew?\" ",
            "Feakew walked over and placed a hand to Thundrax’s back, \"Better?\" ",
            "Thundrax nodded, \"I think we’ve made quite a bit of progress with our training. I doubt we could defend ourselves long against the sisters if they decide we’re in their way, but we can definitely lend a hand against whatever great power is rising.\" ",
            "Feakew nodded, \"I think we’ve all made quite a bit of progress. It may be time to move on from this forest. After all, we’ve heard nothing from the outside world since the last full moon.\" ",
            "Natalia slid into Thundrax’s arms, nodding her agreement, \"Can you lead us out of here, Ekosa?\" ",
            "She nodded and pointed towards a familiar tree and trotted towards it, \"This way.\" ",
            "Before she got far a mesh of vines grew across the trees, blocking her path. ",
            "\"This forest is alive\", Nakomis spoke from behind the group, \"The trees are able to shift their position in order to confuse those within the forest. That path will lead you deeper into this forest. If you want to leave, I can show you out.\" ",
            "Ekosa spun around, staring past the wooden woman, \"The only fix I can get on our position is from the trees. If they can all reorganize themselves, I am truly lost.\" ",
            "Nakomis smiled, \"One of the great powers this forest posses is the ability to beat an enemy by waiting them out.\" She tucked a vine behind the corner of the wooden mask as she considered her words, \"It also holds half of my power. If we leave here, I will not be able to offer my full abilities to this cause.\" ",
            "Thundrax nodded, and looked down the new path, \"We cannot wait for our enemy to come to us. We have to bring our fight to their doorstep.\" ",
            "Nakomis let out a small sigh before turning and choosing a direction. With each step she took, the trees and vines pulled back to reveal a clear path. "

            "Mailay rushed towards the small tower, keeping her body low and a sai in each hand. A few arrows rained down from its peak, slamming into the dirt where she had just been. She spun around the side of the tower, leaping into the air and landing solidly against an iron door with both feet. After letting loose a horrible wrenching sound, the door fell from its hinges. Mailay rode it to the ground and sprinted up the tower stairs. As she reached the top of the tower, she through her body to the side of the stairwell, narrowly dodging the twirling axe that flew through the air. ",
            "In front of her, a tall, wide man stood. He was covered in dingy, gray armor. Thick metal boots covered his feet, overlapping the layer of armor that protected his legs and torso. The armor at his shoulders bulged out from his body, adding a sense of power to his already stout frame. Thick gloves covered his hands, a strip of the metal fastened over each knuckle to the hard leather underneath. At his waist, several scabbards and straps hung. Each one held a terrifying weapon, except for one engraved scabbard hanging from his right hip. The sword had already been drawn from it and now swayed in the man’s hand, waiting for its opportunity to strike. ",

Within moments, the wall began to undulate as if it was alive, dozens of the figures filtering into the city. The figures split into groups of two and filed down the dark streets, each silently picking the lock of the first building, and disappearing into the house. Moments later, another wave of shadows filtered over the wall and met the first at the doors of their houses, picking up various jewels and valuables before disappearing back over the wall. The first wave continued down the streets, systematically pilfering from every house in the city. ",
            "As the wave of figures finally reached the last rows of houses, the door of one of the first houses swung open. The group swiftly moved as one, hiding in the spaces between houses. By the time the man looked up from his door, he found only darkness. The man tested his door from the outside, curiously inspecting the door knob. As the man opened his mouth to sound an alarm, a glint of metal flew through the air, tore through his windpipe and landed in the wall of his house with a thud. The group of shadows emerged from their hiding places and made for the wall as the man bled out onto his front porch, grasping desperately at his wound. By the time a woman came out to check on him, the shadows had already disappeared back into the forest from which they’d come. "

The street dead-ended into the huge building. The building rose in tiers, each with a staircase, surrounded by ornately carved statues and heavily armored guards. As the group approached, a man behind Mailay shouted to the guards and rather than obstructing their progress, they joined the mass of men. They marched deliberately on their own capitol.

            "Sorsia wandered out of her suite at the local hotel, wearing her newest outfit, complete with an elaborate golden necklace which had a large green gem set into it. She noticed a pamphlet fluttering through the air and brought it to her hand with a delicate movement. The pamphlet spoke of a great country that was fighting the corruption of the world. It asked for allegiance and promised a utopia to anyone who joined them. ",
            "Sorsia’s expression turned to shock as she read on. This was the great enemy she had trained for so long to combat. Her mind raced over the resources she had managed to pool in the city and she realized that she had only begun to amass any actual power. Her charm over the chief of police was really the only sway she had acquired. While it was quite useful in smoothing out her inevitable conflicts within the city, it would do little in a full scale battle. ",
            "A newfound purpose in her gate, Sorsia hurried to her golem, lifting herself smoothly to its peak. A touch of magic brought it once again to life, and it lumbered away from the fine hotel, and into the street. She was deep in thought, muttering ancient magical words and carving sketches of spells into the side of the golem as it slowly worked its way deeper into the city, leaving the shops of the commercial district behind. Before long, the towering houses of nobles and wealthy merchants lined the streets, visible through intricate gates, carefully trimmed trees and bushes formed into the shape of exotic animals. In a few of the lawns, servants toiled in their simple, black uniforms, pulling weeds or trimming stray branches. Slowly, the houses grew larger, and fell back farther from the street, connected by long, winding roads and lined with carefully carved busts of family lineage. Eventually, the golem stopped as the road dead ended into a thick gate, twice the width of the road. It was constructed from beams of skeerwood and reinforced with decorative strips of iron. The gate was easily twice as tall as Sorsia, even when riding her golem. It was matched in size by the thick stone walls that straddled it, formed from a myriad of chiseled, stone bricks. ",
            "Sorsia was still deep in her musings when an armored man spoke to her in a loud, commanding voice, \"What is your business here, miss?\" ",
            "Stirred from her thoughts, Sorsia took in the scene around her. The soldier seemed a part of the décor. He was an imposing figure, taller than most she had seen in town, and seemed thick with muscle. He stood just to the side of the gate, sparkling in polished armor from his ornate helmet to his thick gauntlets and spotless greaves. An impossibly narrow slit across the eyes was the only gap in the metal, as far as she could tell, and even that showed nothing but shadows beneath. A picture of some sort of soaring bird was engraved into his chest piece, the animal appearing again on a flag which flapped from the tip of his long spear. Another man mirrored the first on the opposite side of the gate, seemingly chosen to match the height and girth of the first. Neither had moved a muscle for her arrival, in fact, they still seemed to be staring off down the long road on which she had come. ",
            "\"If you have no business within the castle walls, I’m going to have to ask you to leave.\" The man spoke again, harsher this time. ",
            "Sorsia blinked at the man, taking in his words for the first time, a moment later, she was ready to make her demand, \"Open the gates; I have business with your queen.\" Annoyed, she returned her attention to her most recent sketch. ",
            "For the first time, the guards turned their heads, contemplating Sorsia. ",
            "\"I’ll need your name and a brief description of your purpose \" ",
            "For a moment, Sorsia didn’t respond at all, then she lifted herself into the air above her golem, \"I am Sorsia, one of the sisters of Acacia, and I demand to see your queen to discuss the eminent threat that will soon sweep over this land! Now, open the gates or I’ll open them myself.\" A sly smile spread across her lips, \"I won’t be as gentle.\" ",
            "The two soldiers exchanged a quick glance before the man on the left spoke again as if explaining the world to a small child, \"The sisters of Acacia are a myth told in bedtime stories. You obviously posses some magical power, but that alone will not get you through these gates. They have been warded against such attacks by the royal family’s personal mages. If you give me your real name, I will have a request sent for a meeting with one of the arbiters, but I will not receive a response until tomorrow, at the earliest.\" ",
            "Sorsia felt her fury rise up, sending waves of magic pulsing through her arms, but pushed it back and concentrated on Arsenatio’s words, ‘Don’t forget that we are now a part of prophecy. Religious fanaticism is a far greater motivator than fear, or respect of power.’ Once she had calmed herself, she spoke again in a level voice, \"I have given you my true name. I am one of the sisters of Acacia of which the prophecies speak. I will wait if I must, but I must discuss the coming battle with your leaders.\" ",
            "The man returned to his pose, staring off down the road, \"I will relay your words. Come back tomorrow for a decision.\" The other guard had copied the first’s movements, returning to his post. ",
            "Sorsia thought for a moment, \"Is there a place nearby that I can stay for the night? It’s half a day’s walk to my hotel.\" ",
            "The guards nodded in unison, \"There is a small trail off to the right just a little ways back. Follow it and you will come to a… waiting area.\" ",
            "Sorsia nodded her appreciation before turning her golem and walking back down the road. "

            "Arsenatio awoke slowly when he heard a light tap at the skeerwood door. The morning’s light was already pouring through his massive window, causing him to squint while his eyes adjusted. With a deep breath, he pushed his thick, finther down comforter off of his chest. A light groan emanated from his left as a naked beauty pulled the blanket back up over her head. He had to dodge another woman as he climbed off the edge of the gigantic bed. Arsenatio smiled at the memory of the night before as he pulled on a pair of black slacks with a detailed ring of embroidery around the ankles. Once it was secured by a sash, he pulled a matching robe over his head and walked across the thick, baer hide rug which lay by the door. He quickly slipped out of the room, closing the door behind himself. ",

            "Arsenatio strolled out of the wide hallway, passing large suits of armor and finely crafted golden statues, into a small garden he had ordered constructed. A small waterfall gently flowed from one shallow pool into another. The trees above shaded the area, keeping it very comfortable in even the warmest weather. Small bushes and vines with a wide variety of berries grew everywhere. Arsenatio snatched up a few and continued on into the audition room. ",
            "The room was fairly small compared to the others, and dimly lit. Before his arrival it had housed dozens of finely made urns filled with the ashes of the past kings. Windows were set in the back that allowed streams of morning light to fall majestically across a raised platform which had held the urns, creating an aura of peace and tranquility. The platform made an excellent stage for his purposes. He fell into his overstuffed chair at the base of the stage, and closed his eyes while he awaited the morning entertainment. ",
            "A little while later, he heard the wooden door on the far side slowly creek open. He opened his eyes and watched as three new girls walked cautiously across the stage. The door quickly closed behind them, a latch audibly falling into place a moment later. The girls looked around the room curiously, eventually finding Arsenatio’s form and resting there gaze on him. They each wore a thin shirt with short sleeves which stopped about half-way down their thighs. As they swayed into the streams of light, the light cloth became nearly transparent. ",
            "Arsenatio smiled warmly, \"I’m Arsenatio, the great mage and scholar who trained the sisters of Acaia. Please tell me a little about yourselves.\" His gaze rested solidly on the girl on the left of the stage. ",
            "\"Um\", the girl started for a moment, obviously nervous, \"Your highness, er, I’m sorry, eminence, my name is Angeia. Um, I’m just the daughter of a poor farmer. Oh, and I’m 16.\" ",
            "Arsenatio nodded, \"Why have you come to see me today?\" ",
            "The girl cleared her throat nervously, \"My father couldn’t pay his taxes this year, so he has sent me in order t-\" ",
            "\"In order to save himself\", Arsenatio interrupted. ",
            "The girl stared at a spot on the stage in front of her and bit her lower lip absently, \"It was the best thing for the family. It was just my mother, father, and two little sisters. If he was taken, we would have no one to work the fields.\" ",
            "Arsenatio nodded, \"So you volunteered yourself into servitude to save your family?\" ",
            "The girl nodded slowly. ",
            "\"That was very noble of you\", he turned his gaze carefully to the second girl, \"And you?\" ",
            "The girl held her head up high, \"My name is Deafa. I am 17 and was the daughter of a nobleman, employed by the king to keep track of his finances. His lands were taken from him and he was beheaded when he was accused of stealing from the royal treasury. I was also taken from my family and sentenced to servitude to repay the debt. Evidence has since surfaced to prove that he was betrayed by his closest friend, but the king has already made his decree and it has been difficult to get the case reopened. ",
            "Arsenatio nodded, \"A terrible mistake. I only wish that I had the power to reverse that decision. Maybe…\" He shook his head disappointedly, and then directed his gaze to the third girl. ",
            "The girl swayed comfortably in the small outfit as she spoke, \"I’m Abella. I’m 19 near as I can guess, my parents died when I was a little kid. I haven’t really had a home for as long as I can remember, but I’ve developed a few skills which have allowed me to earn some coin here and there.\" She idly pulled at a corner of her shirt as she continued, \"A few months ago, I met a guy who wanted me to live with him. He let me stay in his house and brought me little shiny things now and then. I was thinking about giving up my old life and staying with him a while. Maybe try and get a regular job. About a month back, he started using some strange plants, and everything changed. He became very agitated and violent. I tried to leave, but he always found me. He knew I had been talking about getting a regular job, so he talked the tavern into hiring me for a nightly show. He got them to pay him a bunch up front so that he could get me a fancy dress and clean me up. Once he got paid, he disappeared. I would have done the show, but they didn’t want to without the fancy clothes and stuff. The king decided that I would serve the tavern until the debt was paid.\" ",
            "Arsenatio nodded slowly, \"You’re forced to pay the price for someone else’s crime.\" He shook his head in disappointment before returning his gaze to the three girls, \"I have asked for you three, specifically, to be brought here because I’ve heard about you’re predicaments. As I’ve said, I do not possess the power to revoke the king’s decree, but he didn’t specify where or how you needed to serve, did he?\" ",
            "The three girls all agreed that he hadn’t. ",
            "\"Then allow me to make you this offer, to minimize the suffering you undergo from these injustices. Stay here, in my wing, and help me when you see the opportunity. I already live here with several people who, like you, were trapped in a bad situation through no fault of their own. They live here with me in comfort. They eat the same foods I receive and sleep in beds as good as my own. Several have already offered to stay after their period of service has expired. I do not need more servants, but I would be honored if you three would stay as my guests. But, the decision is yours; would you like to stay with me until your sentence is over?\" ",
            "The girls exchanged quick glances with each other, and then broke into grins, nodding enthusiastically. ",
            "Arsenatio smiled and rose to his feet, \"Good, then follow me so we can get you some proper clothing.\" ",
            "He quickly opened the door he had entered through and disappeared into the bright light beyond, leaving the door open for the girls to follow. When they caught up, he was staring into the flowing water of the small garden. The girls let their eyes wander about the place, pausing momentarily at the small fruits and berries. ",
            "\"This place is yours to enjoy as you like. I’ve found that the stone walls of this place are a little cold sometimes; it can be nice to have a… familiar place to go. Please, feel free to try anything you find here, I’ve had a few of my favorites planted.\" ",
            "Angeia and Abella quickly grabbed a handful of the treats, while Deafa only smiled at the offer and shook her head politely. A few moments later, Arsenatio was off again, the girls close at his heels. He made a quick right at the first opening and slipped into the room, holding the door open as the girls followed him in. The room was coated in dresses, skirts, shirts, and undergarments of a variety of styles, colors, and sizes. In the far corner, a set of shelves sparkled with jewels , necklaces, bracelets, and earrings. Along the floor, boots, slippers, and sandals were stacked in rows. The girls spread out, each gaping openly at the selection. ",
            "Arsenatio gently shut the door behind them, flipping a small latch. He gently set a magic-warmed hand to each of their shoulders, \"This is where I keep all of the outfits and accessories for those who serve me. Feel free to wear whatever you like.\" ",
            "Deafa turned cautiously, whispering, \"This is what you let your servants wear!?\" ",
            "Arsenatio smiled, shaking his head, \"I don’t like that word, ‘servant’, you are my guests and I’d like to treat you as such.\" ",
            "The girls giggled gleefully as they flipped through the outfits, pulling out ones that they especially liked and holding them up, to see how they would look in them. ",
            "\"Do you have a place that we can try these on?\", Deafa asked, a flowing, burgundy dress in one hand, and silk stockings in the other. ",
            "Arsenatio pursed his lips and shook his head in disappointment, \"I’m afraid I haven’t been able to procure a room for that yet. You can change now if you would like, otherwise you’ll have to wait until after I’ve shown you around the rest of this place. It is pretty large and will probably take all day, so I wanted to give you the chance to get into something that suits your status here. It’s up to you.\" As Arsenatio spoke, his hand warmed again with magic. He gently touched it to each of the girl’s faces. \"It’s such a shame to hide your beauty behind those servant rags. Please, let me treat you as my guests.\" ",
            "Abella gave a little shrug and tore off her shirt, tossing it on the floor. She pulled a peach dress on over her head, and turned to the other two, \"How do I look?\" ",
            "Slowly, the other two girls experimented with different outfits, at first pulling satin pants on to hide their forms. Given some time, and a few more intoxicating, magical brushes from Arsenatio, the three girls were throwing dresses, shirts, and skirts left and right in an attempt to find the perfect outfit for a tour of the castle.

            "As Mailay walked through the ranks of training soldiers, Loki shadowing her as always, she could see her effect on them. Whenever she walked by, their eyes drifted and it took them a moment longer to respond to their orders. This behavior was not limited to the peons, the generals she had appointed suffered from the same affliction. ",
            "\"General\", she spoke as she approached a portly figure covered in armor, \"Your men are overexerting themselves in their parry. Focus on it for a few days.\" ",
            "The general nodded eagerly, then turned to his men, bellowing across the ranks, \"Our queen has suggested we work on our parry. It seems you are putting far too much energy into it. Remember, you don’t need to stop the blow, just deflect it.\" ",
            "Each row of men swiftly turned to face the row next to it, forming training pairs. Within moments the pairs were swinging at each other with blunt, wooden swords. ",
            "Mailay nodded, \"Good. Now be sure that they don’t return to their old habits.\" ",
            "The man gave a quick salute and began pacing the rows of soldiers, shouting out orders whenever he could find reason. ",
            "Mailay continued on like this, as she did every three or four days. It took nearly half a day to walk through the sea of soldiers, but it was necessary to direct their training. It also solidified their devotion to her cause. ",
            "Once she had finished her rounds, she continued her routine, walking in to her private training circle. Loki lifted a pair of blunted axes from the barrel of weapons and stood opposite Mailay, who held an equally blunt short-sword in each hand. ",
            "The blunted weapons were more for his protection than hers. He had managed to get a glancing hit in on rare occasion, but she seemed to deflect his attacks most of the time. Sometimes, she was actually able to aim the deflected axe back into his body. He hadn’t been able to prevent it at first, but he was gaining a considerably better understanding of how to direct his attack in such a way that it limited her options for deflection. ",
            "Mailay tossed her swords to the ground at Loki’s feet, \"You’ve done well at learning to control your weapon after a parry, but I’d like to show you one of the advantages of wielding an axe. Give me your axes and attack me.\" ",
            "Loki smoothly tossed his axes into the air and swept up the swords at his feet. He slowly worked his way towards Mailay, parrying her quick attacks.  In one swift motion, she tipped the front of his sword down with one axe, and used the other to grab the sword near the hilt and tear it from his hand, sending it flying onto the arena floor behind him.. With the loss of one of his weapons, Loki tried desperately to back away while sporadically moving his blade into the path of the oncoming axes. Unable to keep up, he took the full force of several swings, causing him to wince in pain as he stumbled towards the fallen sword. He fell towards it and rolled back to his feet with both swords in hand, panting heavily. Moments later, he found the tip of each of his swords caught in Mailay’s axes once more. He wasn’t able to control his weapons as they crossed in front of him. The hilts hit one another and each sword tore away from his hands, sliding across the dry earth of the dueling circle a pace away in either direction. Before Loki was able to consider a course of action, he found an axe on either side of his neck, looping behind his head. ",
            "Mailay’s head appeared inches from his eyes and the axes fell onto his chest, \"Now you try.\" "

            "Sorsia’s golem wandered down the thin trail for quite some time as Sorsia debated which spell to use to correct the guards insolence. It was nearing nightfall when she came across the ‘waiting area. She glanced up briefly, and her attention was caught by the large building before her. It was a large, run down house which doubtlessly held dozens of rooms. In its prime, it must have been a remarkable sight, but little care had been put towards preserving that elegance. A porch wrapped around the building, holding several overstuffed couches and chairs, some of which held a scantily-clad woman posing provocatively. A man dressed in a plain robe walked around the porch, staring at each of the women and making quick small-talk as he passed. As he wandered over to a young brunette woman, he produced a sparkling coin. He placed it gently in her hand as he leaned in for a quick kiss. Moments later, he was following the woman into the old building. ",
            "Sorcia’s anger surged again as she realized where the guard had sent her. She quickly scratched out a few of the spells which would offer him a quick death, opting for a bit of torture. She eased her golem around the back of the building, and floated softly to the ground. As she worked her way across the porch, a man approached her with a glistening coin in his hand. The man doubled over in pain when Sorsia gently swatted his hand away, a spark arcing through the air. She mercilessly jabbed her foot into his stomach as she stepped over him, flowing smoothly through the door and into the disheveled building. ",
            "The inside of the building looked just as run down as outside. Tarnished, dust-ridden chandeliers hung from the ceiling and cheap patch jobs held the grand staircase together. More overstuffed furniture littered the gigantic living room, women of varying age and states of nudity strewn across them. ",

            "\"I’d like a room for the night\", she explained confidently. ",

            "An odd look of understanding spread across the old woman’s face, \"We may have a room available for your particular needs, but there will be a severe punishment if you are found interfering with how we do business here\". She pulled her face close, \"That includes engaging in services already offered by our employees. If you would like, I can have some of the servant men stop by. They are quite well endowed and have been taught several techniques for improving their stamina.\" ",
            "Sorsia grit her teeth and shook her head at the woman. She couldn’t help wondering how much it would really hurt her mission if this place were wiped from the landscape. ",
            "\"Then it will be 5 gold pieces for the night. It may seem like a lot, but we could make three times that easily if it were used for other purposes\", the woman spoke as she lifted a heavy, iron key from behind the door. ",

            "Sorsia nodded, and hurried toward the stairs. She stomped down them, and stormed to her door without anyone else noticing her. The key slid easily into the lock, and turned with little effort, allowing her to slip inside quickly. She stood with her back against the door and waited for her rage to subside. ",
            "When it had at last chilled to a soft glow, she turned to lock the door. There was no key hole on the inside of the door. It was just solid wood with a small metal knob which could be used to open it. Sorsia shook her head as she lifted two fingers toward the door and whispered a spell. As she rotated her hand, the lock audibly slid into place. ",
            "She walked over to the bed and let out a sigh as she lifted a thin sheet, and lay down on the rock-hard mattress. Between the uncomfortable bed, and the cries of pleasure emanating from throughout the building, a good night’s sleep was quite elusive. "

This could help to explain his unnaturally explosive reactions to anyone who doesn’t show him respect. As a prophet, he may have been seen as a low level mage before he disappeared into the ‘bubble’ with the sisters. He could have generated the prophecy from his own imagination. The great evil is a vague threat that could be attributed to anything once he awoke from the bubble. He hoped that the story of him and the powerful sisters would launch him into a position of power fueled by near-religious devotion. He chose to take the sisters with him both because their power was well known and would fuel rumors of his sacritice and because of their uncommon beauty.
