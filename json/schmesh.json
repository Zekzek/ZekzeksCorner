The moves available to each piece are based on the board location rather than intrinsic to the piece itself. It battles the user with such AI algorithms as minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and iterative deepening. Written in C++, it went beyond the course requirements by utilizing Microsoft's API to develop a simple GUI." ],
